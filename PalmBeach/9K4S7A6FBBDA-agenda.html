<div class="itembody"><P><U><STRONG>Workshop Purpose:</STRONG></U></P><br /><br /><P>Obtain Board consensus on when the District should waive fees normally charged for using District facilities. Staff will use feedback from this workshop to prepare proposed revisions to School Board Policy 7.18 Community Use of School Facilities.</P><br /><br /><P><U><STRONG>Scope of Workshop:</STRONG></U></P><br /><br /><P>Staffs intent is to only cover commercial leases briefly.&nbsp; The main focus is on non-commercial uses, however, since there may be differences of opinion about what is and is not a commercial use&nbsp;we will need to address this issue to some extent.</P><br /><br /><P>The ongoing audits of leases are not the subject of this workshop.&nbsp; These issues are being addressed with the Audit committee and a subsequent report will be made to the Board on this subject.</P><br /><br /><P><U><STRONG>Background:</STRONG></U></P><br /><br /><P>The District is getting much more vigilant about ensuring leases are prepared when required by School Board Policy.&nbsp; This added vigilance which was partially initiated in response to audit findings and partially out of a need to realize additional funds to support school activities, has brought to light various situations which do not fit neatly into the current policy.</P><br /><br /><P>This workshop is also necessitated by apparent differences of opinion regarding when District facilities should or should not be available for use for free.&nbsp; Organizations that do not believe they should pay for the use of the District's facilities may call the Superintendent's Office or the Board Office in an attempt to persuade District Leadership to waive fees.&nbsp; </P><br /><br /><P><STRONG><U>Issues:</U></STRONG></P><br /><br /><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Should the School District waive all fees, including labor, for non-profit organizations that provide a direct&nbsp; benefit to multiple public school students?<BR><STRONG>Staff Recommendation:</STRONG>&nbsp; Yes, however, they should pay for utilities during off-hours and there should be a limit on how much is waived for labor and utilities in order to keep them from abusing the privilege and driving up costs for the District.</P><br /><br /><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Should the District reimburse schools for their actual cost (labor, custodial supplies, etc.) to allow for free use of their facilities by non-profits and community members?<BR><STRONG>Staff Recommendation</STRONG>:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; There are some incidents where School Police will also be required and their budget would also need to be reimbursed.</P><br /><br /><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; Should the Board enter into interlocal or mutual use agreements with the municipalities to allow the District to use their meeting spaces (rooms, auditoriums, etc.) fee of charge and vice versa?&nbsp; <BR><STRONG>Staff Recommendation</STRONG>: Yes.&nbsp; This is the common practice now, but it is not documented.</P><br /><br /><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; Should the Board allow charter schools to use District school facilities at no charge or at a reduced rate?<BR><STRONG>Staff Recommendation</STRONG>:&nbsp; We may be required to make District school facilities available to charter schools under the same terms we would make them available to other District schools.&nbsp; We would not charge one District school rent to use another District school, however, if&nbsp; revenue were to be generated from some type of fundraising activity (ex. fair, tournament, etc.) we would expect there to be some revenue sharing between the schools.&nbsp; We would also expect the visiting school to provide custodial assistance including replacement of consumable supplies if warranted. </P><br /><br /><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp; Should the Board have a category for special organizations based on past relationships which may not have been documented or force all groups into&nbsp;one of the other categories?<BR><STRONG>Staff Recommendation</STRONG>:&nbsp; There should be no special category; all groups should fit within one of the proposed categories.&nbsp; If a special use is required that does&nbsp;not fall into the parameters of the revised policy a special lease should be prepared and presented to the Board for approval.</P><br /><br /><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp; Should all schools be required or encouraged to make their recreation facilities (fields, tracts, gyms and playgrounds) available for certain hours at no cost?<BR><STRONG>Staff Recommendation</STRONG>:&nbsp; Schools should be encouraged, but not required to make their facilities available because some schools are harder to secure.&nbsp; There are also some schools that have more academic challenges than others and opening their facilities to the public takes away from the ability to focus on the District core mission.</P><br /><br /><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Should administrative procedures be prepared to address details such as what happens if the space is not usable by the lessee or there is damage to the facilities?<BR><STRONG>Staff Recommendation</STRONG>:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Staff intends to submit administrative procedures with the updated policy.</P><br /><br /><P><BR><STRONG><U>Reference Materials</U></STRONG>:</P><br /><br /><P>&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Community Use of Facilities is addressed is School Board Policy 7.18.</P><br /><br /><P>&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lease rates are updated annually and approved by the School Board.&nbsp; These rates and other information about leasing school facilities can be found on the Real Estate Services<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; website via the following link:http://cms.palmbeach.k12.fl.us/cms/section_display.cfm?section_id=123&amp;top=3&amp;level=3</P><br /><br /><P>&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schools districts are allowed to lease their facilities in accordance with Florida Statue 1013.15(1).<BR></P><h3>Contact:</h3><p>Joseph Sanches (<A href="mailto:sanchesj@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">sanchesj@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A>)</p><h3>Financial Impact:</h3><p>N/A</p></div>
