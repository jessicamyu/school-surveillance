<div class="itembody"><P>The Department of Charter Schools received an application from Cornerstone Academy for High Standards ("CAHS") to open a charter school in the School District of Palm Beach County on August 1, 2007.</P><br /><br /><P>The application was evaluated using the new "Florida Charter School Application Instrument" that was piloted by Districts in Florida (see Exhibit "A").&nbsp; Florida Department of Education conducted a workshop to sponsors and applicants on June 12, 2007 and July 17, 2007 (see Exhibit "B").</P><br /><br /><P>The instrument and the application process were explained to the applicants during the New Applicants' Workshop that was held on May 31, 2007 (see Exhibit "C").</P><br /><br /><P>The District Reviewers were trained on the Florida Charter School Application Evaluation Instrument and Application Process on April 17, 2007 (see Exhibit "D").</P><br /><br /><P>The Reviewers evaluated the 21 sections of the written application and identified deficiencies.&nbsp; Seven of the 21 sections were rated "Partially Meets the Standard," meaning the responses addressed most of the criteria, but lacked meaningful detail and required important additional information.&nbsp; Nine of the 21 sections were rated as "Does Not Meet Standards," meaning the responses lacked meaningful detail, demonstrated lack of preparation, or otherwise raised substantial concerns about the applicant's understanding of the issue and/or ability to meet the requirements in practice (see Exhibit "E").</P><br /><br /><P>The responses to each section that did not meet the stated criteria served as the basis of inquiry for the interview.&nbsp; Please refer to Step 5:&nbsp; Applicant Interview (see Exhibit "F").</P><br /><br /><P>Based on the written application and the interview, this application has significant weaknesses in 16 sections.&nbsp; Step 6, second paragraph in the Overview of the Florida Charter School Application Process states, "The sponsoring board will only approve applicants that demonstrate quality in all components of the application process. An application cannot have significant weaknesses in some components of the application and still be judged to have met the standard for approval," (see Exhibit "G").&nbsp; Each applicant received communication that outlined the proposed recommendation, the evaluator's second review following the interview, summary of the interview, and was granted the option to voluntarily withdraw the application or allow the application to be denied by the School Board (see Exhibit&nbsp; "H").</P><br /><br /><P>Pursuant to F.S.1002.33 (5)(c):<BR>"An applicant may appeal any denial of that applicant's application or failure to act on an application to the State Board of Education no later than 30 calendar days, after receipt of the sponsor's decision or failure to act and shall notify the sponsor of its appeal . . ."</P><br /><br /><P>A copy of CAHS's application is in the Board Office for your review.</P><br /><br /><P>&nbsp;</P><h3>Recommendation:</h3><p>I recommend that the School Board deny the application of Cornerstone Academy for High Standards, Inc. and authorize the Superintendent or designee to sign all related contracts and documents.</p><h3>Contact:</h3><p>Ann Killets/(<A href="mailto:akillets@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">akillets@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A>) <BR>Janice S.
