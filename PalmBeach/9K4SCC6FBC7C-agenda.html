<div class="itembody"><UL><br /><br /><LI>The School Distirct and the City of Lake Worth had a prior ILA for use of the City's baseball field, known then as Dick Brown Colt Field, in 1992. <br /><br /><LI>The previous ILA was in effect for three (3) years.&nbsp; It lapsed in 1995 with no update or replacement agreement. <br /><br /><LI>Certain items at the facility were in a state of disrepair and there was disagreement between the two parites as to which entity would be responsible for certain repairs. <br /><br /><LI>The new ILA clearly states the maintenance responsibilities of both parties and assures that the Lake Worth Community High School baseball team will be able to use the field for its athletic events.&nbsp; The ILA will be effective for five (5) years after it has been approved by both entities. <br /><br /><LI>There are specific maintenance items that will be addressed in two (2) phases, ending in December of 2010.&nbsp; The approximate cost for both phases of work by the School District is $200,000.00.&nbsp; The ILA specifies a commitment by the School District of no more than $250,000.00 for maintenance during the two (2) phases.&nbsp; The additional $50,000 is to cover any cost increases for materials or other contingencies.</LI></UL><h3>Recommendation:</h3><p>I recommend the School Board approve the Interlocal Agreement (ILA) between the City of Lake Worth and the School Board of Palm Beach County to clarify maintenance issues and secure use of the field for Lake Worth Community High School during baseball season and authorize the Chairman and Superintendent to sign all necessary documents.</p><h3>Contact:</h3><p>Joseph Sanches; Joseph Moore</p><h3>Financial Impact:</h3><p>No more than $250,000.00 from the School District's Capital Budget.</p></div>
