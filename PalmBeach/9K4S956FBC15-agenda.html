<div class="itembody">The Department of Charter Schools received an application, on August 2, 2010, from My Choice Academy ("My Choice") to open a charter school in the School District of Palm Beach County in August, 2011. The application was evaluated using the "Florida Charter School Application Instrument" (see Exhibit "A"). The instrument and the application process were explained to the applicants during the New Applicants' Workshop that was held on May 27, 2010 (see Exhibit "B"). The District Reviewers were trained on the Florida Charter School Application Evaluation Instrument and Application Process on May 13, 2010 (see Exhibit "C"). The Reviewers evaluated the 20 sections of the written application. Three of the 20 sections were rated "Partially Meets the Standard or Did Not Meet the Standard," meaning the responses addressed most of the criteria, but lacked meaningful detail and required important additional information (see Exhibit "D"). Partially Meets the Standard: Section 7 - English Language Learners Did Not Meet the Standard: Section 9 - Governance Section 18 - Budget The responses to each section that did not meet the stated criteria served as the basis of inquiry for the interview. Please refer to Step 5: Applicant Interview (see Exhibit "E"). Step 6, second paragraph in the Overview of the Florida Charter School Application Process states, "The sponsoring board will only approve applicants that demonstrate quality in all components of the application process. An application cannot have significant weaknesses in some components of the application and still be judged to have met the standard for approval," (see Exhibit "F"). Each applicant received communication that outlined the proposed recommendation, the evaluators' second review following the interview, summary of the interview, and was granted the option to voluntarily withdraw the application or allow the application to be placed on the Board agenda for action (see Exhibit "G"). Pursuant to F.S.1002.33 (5)(c): "An applicant may appeal any denial of that applicant's application or failure to act on an application to the State Board of Education no later than 30 calendar days, after receipt of the sponsor's decision or failure to act and shall notify the sponsor of its appeal . . ." A copy of My Choice's application is in the Board Office for your review.<h3>Recommendation:</h3><p>I recommend that the School Board deny the application of My Choice Academy and authorize the Superintendent or designee to sign all related contracts and documents.</p><h3>Contact:</h3><p>Ann Killets (akillets@palmbeach.k12.fl.us Janice S.
