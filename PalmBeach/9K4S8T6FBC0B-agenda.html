<div class="itembody"><P>P1 Approve renewal of RFP 07C-002B for Advertising District-Wide Adult &amp; Community Education Program Schedules with Florida Pennysaver/Palm Beach Newspapers</P><br /><br /><P>The original contract was awarded by the Board on January 24, 2007 for the period of February 2, 2007 through October 1, 2009 with the option to renew for two additional one-year periods. The first option to renew was exercised for the period of October 2, 2009 through October 1, 2010. This is the second and final renewal.</P><br /><br /><P>The Palm Beach Community Educator has been advertising adult and community education classes for the past ten years.&nbsp; The Educator is mailed three times a year to over 600,000 homes throughout Palm Beach County. After the inception of the Community Educator in 2000, Adult and Community Education experienced a significant increase in student enrollment. </P><br /><br /><P>The following is a list of benefits as a direct result of advertising with the Palm Beach Community Educator:</P><br /><br /><P>1) Adult and Community Education is categorically funded by the Department of Education and/or student fees.&nbsp; The entire program, which includes the funding of the Educator, has no impact on the K-12 budget. The Palm Beach County School District receives approximately $1.4 million for supporting Adult and Community Education programs.</P><br /><br /><P>2) The funds generated from the classes advertised in the Community Educator are the only source of revenue used to fund the K-12 tutoring support program. With the revenue generated last year, 110 schools were provided tutoring assistance and awarded 6,600 hours of tutoring instruction (60 hours per school) at a cost of $165,000.&nbsp; </P><br /><br /><P>3) High School Credit Lab - Last year 3,515 high school students enrolled in credit recovery programs in order to get back on track to graduate. The credit labs are open in the summer for seniors who did not graduate with their class. This past summer, accessibility of credit labs enabled 91 seniors to graduate and 1,292 credits were earned by participating students.&nbsp; The Credit Labs are advertised in the Educator. </P><br /><br /><P>4) 1,585 residents earned a State of Florida High School Diploma by passing the GED last year.&nbsp; This program is advertised in the Educator.</P><br /><br /><P>5) The Educator advertises leasing opportunities to outside agencies and organizations.&nbsp; Leasing generates money for the district as well as the school centers. In 2008-2009 leasing generated $1,459,214 in revenue.</P><br /><br /><P>6) In 2009-2010, Community Schools provided ongoing How to be a Better Substitute classes for 1,060 new daytime substitute teacher applicants. These classes are advertised in the Educator.</P><br /><br /><P>7) Over 56,000 tax payers participated in Adult and Community Education programs last year.</P><br /><br /><P>8) The Educator advertises English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESL) programs and citizenship classes for the growing non-English speaking population.&nbsp; Last year 16,328 students participated in the ESL programs.</P><br /><br /><P>9) The Educator is used as a vehicle for disseminating school district information, such as the half cent sales tax referendum. In addition, the upcoming distribution of the educator will include information regarding the proposed property tax changes.</P><br /><br /><P>10) The Educator is distributed to all citizens of Palm Beach County, regardless if they have school-aged children.&nbsp; Some programs are provided free of charge and others at very affordable prices.</P><br /><br /><P>In summary, the Palm Beach Community Educator's benefits far outweigh the cost.&nbsp; The main goals are to provide life-long learning opportunities to our citizens, assist the K-12 program, and make the community a better place to live. The Palm Beach Community Educator is our life line and we are requesting the continued support of the school district.</P><br /><br /><P>The total cost of the Community Educator is funded through Adult and Community Education. The approximate total cost ranges from $407,580.00 up to $475,000.00.&nbsp; Adult Education is categorically funded by Workforce Development funds through the Department of Education.&nbsp; The cost of the Winter 2010 Community Educator is approximately $135,502.00 and will be funded through Workforce Development funds.&nbsp; The cost of the Spring 2011 Community Educator is approximately $135,851.00 and the cost of the Fall 2011 Community Educator is approximately $136,227.00.&nbsp; Both issues will be funded through fees generated from fee supported classes and GED fees.&nbsp; Community Education funds include a $10 registration fee. 10% of the class fees plus $4 of the registration fee are used for funding the K-12 Tutoring Support grant.&nbsp; $6 dollars of the registration fee is allocated for the printing and distribution of the Palm Beach Community Educator.&nbsp; </P><h3>Recommendation:</h3><p>I recommend approval of the renewal of RFP 07C-002B for Advertising District-Wide Adult &amp; Community Education Program Schedules for the period of October 2, 2010 through October 1, 2011.</p><h3>Contact:</h3><p><P>Joseph M. Moore, Chief Operating Officer (<A href="mailto:moorej@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">moorej@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A>)</P><br /><br /><P>Judith Klinek, Assistant Superintendent, Grants Admin. &amp; School Reform Accountability </P></p><h3>Financial Impact:</h3><p>There is no financial impact to the K-12 operating budget. The funding comes from fees generated from Community Education classes, GED fees and Workforce Education funding.</p></div>

Joseph Littles-Nguzo-Saba Charter School notified the School District that a portion of their facilities affecting approximately 65 middle school&nbsp;students failed inspection and those facilities could not be made ready prior to the opening of school, however improvements are expected to be completed before January 2011.<BR>4. Since the Inlet Grove Community High School facility was temporarily available Joseph Littles-Nguzo-Saba Charter School's&nbsp;middle school&nbsp;students were permitted to occupy a portion of&nbsp; Bldg. 3 at Inlet Grove until December 23, 2010 to alleviate the critical situation.<BR>5.
