<div class="itembody"><P>The Statewide Online Tobacco Prevention and Intervention Teacher Training Project was created last year based on the findings and recommendations from The Needs, Barriers, and Challenges in Tobacco Prevention and Intervention Teacher Training Program among School Districts in Florida Report by the University of Florida.&nbsp; The report recommended that the Florida Department of Education consider using an online program for teacher training and grant reporting. Student Intervention Services in the Department of Safe Schools conducted tobacco prevention teacher training for nine years under grants from the Florida Department of Education (FLDOE) Office of Healthy Schools.&nbsp;&nbsp; For three years, this training was online.&nbsp; The FL DOE stated that, "as a leader in Florida with establishing online tobacco prevention teacher training, Palm Beach County has laid the foundation to create a statewide online component in support of the funding priorities." Therefore, in July 2010, the FL DOE issued a Non-Competitive Discretionary Request for Application (RFA) to the School District of Palm Beach County to provide the training statewide, to all districts.&nbsp; The district expects the grant to be reissued for SY 2012 to begin July 1, 2012 and intends to apply.&nbsp; </P><br /><br /><P>The Midyear Report for 2012 by W. William Chen, Ph.D., CHES, Department of Health Education &amp; Behavior, University of Florida, and his colleagues, concludes that teachers who took the course and their students demonstrate statistically significant improvements.&nbsp; Teachers'&nbsp; pre post surveys measure knowledge. The student assessments measure the impact the teacher's online training has on their students regarding changes in knowledge about tobacco hazards, media influences over tobacco use, and refusal skills. </P><br /><br /><P>The impact of this project will be measured in the numbers of teachers who complete the course, teachers' increased knowledge of tobacco prevention education and related effective teaching strategies, and increased student knowledge. Tobacco use by students interferes with their academic achievement and is associated with other drug use; school based prevention efforts have demonstrated success in reducing tobacco use among youth. <BR></P><h3>Recommendation:</h3><p><P>I recommend that the School Board approve the Statewide Online Tobacco Prevention and Intervention Teacher Training Project to the Florida Department of Education for up to $300,000 from July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2012, and authorize the Superintendent or designee to sign all documents and contracts related to the grant which are required for implementation of the grant activities.&nbsp; The reason this item is coming to the Board at this time is because the RFA is expected to be received and due before July 1, 2011, and online instructional and support positions are paid for in the budget.&nbsp; </P><br /><br /><P>&nbsp;</P></p><h3>Contact:</h3><p>Judith Klinek (<A href="mailto:klinek@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">klinek@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A>) <BR>Alison Adler&nbsp; <BR></p><h3>Financial Impact:</h3><p>The financial impact to the Special Revenue-Other Funds Budget is an increase of up to $300,000. All project related expenditures and contracts are authorized for payment up to the amount of revenue. There is no financial impact to the Operating Budget.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div>

<div class="itembody"><P>Seven counties in Florida, including Palm Beach County, have zip codes within their boundaries with a disproportionate number of minority youth who come in contact with the juvenile justice system.&nbsp; The District was awarded a grant last year to conduct Project MIND as part of an effort to reduce this number. The program serves black male middle school youth who live within the targeted zip codes.&nbsp; The youth are:&nbsp; a) reviewed by their schools' School Based Team; b) participate in the Ripple Effects evidence-based model on-line program; c) monitored for academic and behavioral concerns by a certified school counselor; and d) referred to additional community resources based on need.&nbsp; Youth are identified through a review of student risk factors according to the Educational Data Warehouse reports and suspension data.&nbsp; The district expects to receive continuation funding. The original proposal received support from the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office; the 15th Judicial Circuit Offices of the Public Defender and State Attorney; the 15th Judicial Circuit Chief Judge and the Juvenile Justice Board Chair.</P><br /><br /><P>The impact of this project will be measured in a reduction in suspensions for bullying, fighting, and threat/ intimidation incidents among black male middle school students in the identified areas and an increase in the number of black male middle school students in those areas referred to the School Based Team and community providers.<BR></P><h3>Recommendation:</h3><p>I recommend that the School Board approve the anticipated continuation of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Title II Disproportionate Minority Contact (DMC) Grant Project for up to $100,000 from July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2012, and authorize the Superintendent or designee to sign all documents and contracts related to the grant which are required for implementation of the grant activities. The reason this item is coming to the Board at this time is because we are expected to receive notice of continued funding before July 1, 2011 and the counselor and data collection/support positions are paid for in the grant budget.&nbsp;</p><h3>Contact:</h3><p>Judith Klinek (<A href="mailto:klinek@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">klinek@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A>) <BR>Alison Adler</p><h3>Financial Impact:</h3><p>The financial impact to the Special Revenue-Other Funds Budget is an increase of up to $100,000.

<div class="itembody"><P>In December of 2009, The School District of Palm Beach County was awarded a $360,000 Healthy Kids, Healthy Communities (HKHC) grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) to increase the opportunities for physical activity and access to affordable healthy foods for children and families in Lake Worth, Greenacres, and Palm Springs communities. Based on a rigorous selection process that drew more than five hundred proposals from across the country, Palm Beach County was selected as one of forty-one sites to receive the grant. The HKHC grant will compliment the District's Wellness Promotion Policy's (2.035) efforts that support healthy eating and active lifestyle changes during the school day. In the first year of the HKHC grant, six community and school gardens have been created.</P><br /><br /><P>On March 15, 2011, the Quantum Foundation granted an additional $150,000.00 to assist The School District of Palm Beach County with expanding on the successes in year one. The HKHC goal is to create policy and environmental changes for children and families by increasing opportunities to access healthy foods and participate in physical activity. With the acceptance of the additional funding, the HKHC project coordinator and project director will create twenty community and school gardens, develop one joint use agreement at a school recreational facility, assist the wellness policy task force and community based organizations with their vending policies, install one community fitness zone, and implement three walking school bus programs within the grant area of Greenacres, Lake Worth, and Palm Springs.&nbsp; There are no additional costs to the District.</P><h3>Recommendation:</h3><p>It is recommended that the School Board of Palm Beach County approve this additional grant funding as it will assist to improve the health and well-being for children and families in Greenacres, Lake Worth, and Palm Springs.</p><h3>Contact:</h3><p><P>Judith Klinek (<A href="mailto:klinek@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">klinek@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A>)</P><br /><br /><P>Contance Tuman-Rugg, Ed.D.

<div class="itembody"><P>This is the annual contract with the Early Learning Coalition of Palm Beach County, Inc. (ELC) that supports the provision of services specified in Section 1003.54, F.S. Teenage Parent Programs to provide Teenage Parent Child Care Services. </P><br /><br /><P>The Early Learning Coalition provides child care resource and referral services and enrollment into child care programs for the children of teenage parents and payment to child care providers for these child care services. The child care programs are for the babies and toddlers of teen parents who are students of the School District. Because the children are in day care, the teen parents are able to attend school. </P><br /><br /><P>We are serving parenting students and their young children by paying for their child care while the teenage parent goes to school. The major goals of these services are to provide pregnant students or students who are parents and children of these students with a comprehensive teenage parent program consisting of educational and ancillary service components. </P><br /><br /><P>ELC will provide, through its authorized vendors, child care resource and referral services and enrollment into child care programs for students in the Teenage Parent Program. ELC will also provide, through its authorized vendors, payment to child care providers for child care services. The School District will document that all children referred by the Teenage Parent Program staff are placed in child care in accordance with the terms of the contract and will review documentation of payments to child care providers. </P><br /><br /><P>The School District will provide funds for this program from FTE generated by the children of teenage parents who are enrolled in the Teenage Parent Program and the cost will be subsidized with State funding (SAI-Supplemental Academic Instruction).&nbsp; The funds will be used by the Florida Partnership for School Readiness to match federal funding brought to Palm Beach County, which goes to the Early Learning Coalition of Palm Beach County, Inc. budget for subsidized child care providers.</P><h3>Recommendation:</h3><p>I recommend that the School Board approve the renewal of the contract with the Early Learning Coalition of Palm Beach County, Inc. for $1,000,303, for the delivery of Teenage Parent Child Care Services from July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2012, and authorize the Superintendent or designee to sign all documents related to the Contract.</p><h3>Contact:</h3><p><P>Judith Klinek (<A href="mailto:klinek@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">klinek@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A>) </P><br /><br /><P>Alison Adler</P></p><h3>Financial Impact:</h3><p>The financial impact to the General Fund Budget is $1,000,303.

<div class="itembody"><P>In December of 2009, The School District of Palm Beach County was awarded a $360,000 Healthy Kids, Healthy Communities (HKHC) grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) to make policy and environmental changes that would decrease obesity in the Lake Worth, Greenacres, and Palm Springs communities. To meet this directive, the HKHC coalition, which is comprised of thirty community stakeholders and organizations, developed goals to increase opportunities for physical activity and to improve access to affordable healthy foods.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P><br /><br /><P>On March 19, 2011, The Law Enforcement Trust Fund granted an additional $10,000 to the HKHC grant to assist with security for a joint-use agreement at one school in the HKHC grant area.&nbsp; With the acceptance of the additional funding, the HKHC project coordinator and project director will identify one school to receive a security fence to separate the school building from a designated recreational area.&nbsp; This will provide community residents an opportunity to become physically active after school hours. The HKHC goal is to create policy and environmental changes for children and families by increasing opportunities to access healthy foods and participate in physical activity.&nbsp; There are no additional costs to the District.</P><h3>Recommendation:</h3><p>It is recommended that the School Board of Palm Beach County approve this additional grant funding as it will assist to improve the health and well-being for children and families in Greenacres, Lake Worth, and Palm Springs.</p><h3>Contact:</h3><p>Judy Klinek, (<A href="mailto:klinek@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">klinek@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A>)<BR>Constance Tuman-Rugg, Ed.D.,, (<A href="mailto:tuman@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">tuman@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A>)<BR>Liz Perlman, (<A href="mailto:LizPerlman@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">LizPerlman@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A>)</p><h3>Financial Impact:</h3><p>The financial impact to the School District is an increase to revenue of $10,000.00.</p></div>

<div class="itembody"><P>Florida Virtual School (FLVS) is an established leader in developing and providing virtual K-12 education solutions to Florida students, using a nationally recognized e-learning model. </P><br /><br /><P>In response to the growth in online education, Florida Virtual School developed the FLVS franchise program. As a franchise, Districts take advantage of the courses and learning management system developed by Florida Virtual School and implements the successful instructional model already in use, using local educators.</P><br /><br /><P>The franchise is implemented through the district's virtual school, Palm Beach Virtual. Palm Beach Virtual operates as a traditional full time school for students in grades 6-12 seeking a standard Palm Beach County diploma. Additionally Palm Beach Virtual is used for part time students in-county who need flexibility in their scheduling to take courses for graduation, acceleration, grade forgiveness or to raise their GPA.</P><br /><br /><P>The renewal of the FLVS franchise for FY12 will allow the District to continue the franchise and broaden the opportunities for students taking virtual education courses through Palm Beach Virtual. </P><h3>Recommendation:</h3><p>I recommend that the School Board approve the purchase of Florida Virtual School Franchise License effective July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2012 and authorize the Superintendent or designee to sign all related documents.</p><h3>Contact:</h3><p><P>Judith <A href="mailto:Klinek@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">Klinek@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A> </P><br /><br /><P>Alison Adler <A href="mailto:aadler@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">aadler@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A> </P><br /><br /><P>Debra Johnson <A href="mailto:johnsod@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">johnsod@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A> </P></p><h3>Financial Impact:</h3><p><P>There is no Franchise Fee for the 2011-2012 contract year.</P><br /><br /><P>The cost of a student utilizing the FLVS system as part of the franchise agreement is $50.00 per half credit. The $50.00 comes out of the FTE generated by the&nbsp; student. </P><br /><br /><P>Each enrollment generates FTE.</P><br /><br /><P>The District will receive revenue from these enrollments that will exceed the cost of this contract. </P><br /><br /><P>&nbsp;</P></p></div>

<div class="itembody"><P>The annual Comprehensive Safety Inspections were performed by the Building Department Fire and Safety Inspectors as required by Florida Statute 1013.12(1). All educational, auxiliary and ancillary facilities were included in these inspections, using (SREF) for casualty and sanitation, and Florida Legislative Chapter 69A-58 for fire safety. In addition, the district Charter schools were inspected for fire safety using (NFPA 101). </P><br /><br /><P>District Fire and Safety Inspectors worked in conjunction with the local fire marshals for each facility. The District successfully reduced the number of citations for Public Schools, Alternative Schools, Charter Schools and Ancillary Facilities from 3,491 in 2010 to 2,837 in 2011. This represents a 18% reduction over one year and a 94% reduction since 2000. </P><br /><br /><P>The District was also able to reduce the overall number of citations while increasing the facility area. All conditions considered by the inspector to be hazardous or posing an imminent danger were reported to Facilities Services at the time of discovery for immediate action. </P><br /><br /><P>A summary of the number of citations for each school and ancillary facility is included with this report. Individual school reports are on file with the Building Department. According to SREF, Chapter 5, the inspection reports shall be approved by the Board, and the Board shall adopt a plan and a schedule for the correction of each deficiency. </P><br /><br /><P>The corrective action plans for each citation were developed in conjunction with the local fire authorities and are included on each report. Upon the board approving the inspection reports, copies of the reports will be submitted to the State Fire Marshal as required by Florida Statute 1013.12(1). These reports must be delivered to the State Fire Marshal by June 30, 2011. </P><h3>Recommendation:</h3><p>I recommend the School Board approve the Comprehensive Safety Inspection Report for FY 2011.</p><h3>Contact:</h3><p>Joseph M. Sanches (sanchesj@palmbeach.k12.fl.us)</p><h3>Financial Impact:</h3><p>Costs associated with correcting the outstanding citations will be addressed in the five year plan.</p></div>

<div class="itembody"><P>PLEASE NOTE: As part of NCLB EETT Title II Part D, private and charter schools must be included in grant development and participation based on compliance with Office of Civil Rights Approved Criteria which is required by the Federal Law. </P><br /><br /><P>The School District of Palm Beach County (SDPBC) plans to implement a Comprehensive Science Investigation (CSI) Palm Beach project. The purpose of this project is to focus on utilizing mobile technology, digital tools, and curriculum integration. Students will draw on 21st century resources using reasoning and deduction skills, developing a hypothesis, and gathering data to enhance cognitive analysis skills. Through the use of digital storytelling tools, such as podcasts and videos, students will document their learning to produce dynamic accounts of their investigations.<BR>CSI Palm Beach has three major goals:</P><br /><br /><P>• Students will create science content through the use of tools such as digital microscopes, probeware, and mobile computing devices. This equipment will allow students to collect, organize, and analyze data focused on real-world learning scenarios.<BR>• Technology Specialists will provide professional development opportunities to support teachers and administrators to transform the classroom environment into a place that supports student-centered learning, teacher guided instruction, and modernized assessments through technology.<BR>• Participants will develop best practices in how to support mobile learning devices in the classroom to provide for continuous learning and modernized assessments.</P><br /><br /><P>With the assistance of district technology specialists, each participating school will identify teachers who specialize in science curriculum in grades 9-12. These teachers will integrate the mobile technology to teach science concepts through a hands-on, project-based approach, stressing real-world exploration. In addition to the mobile technology, teachers will integrate probeware and digital microscopes with students to gain practical experience in collecting, analyzing, and synthesizing information.</P><br /><br /><P>High Quality Professional Development for teachers and administrators will be conducted through the SDPBC No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Initiatives in partnership with the Florida Digital Educator Program and the Master Digital Educator Program. This partnership will align district efforts with state initiatives.&nbsp; In addition, all teachers integrating this equipment will develop a curriculum for the effective use of digital tools in the classroom. A wiki will be created to monitor challenges and successes in using technology in education as well as develop strategies for classroom management and logistics. The wiki can be shared with other teachers on a local and national level.</P><br /><br /><P>Project participants will mentor other teachers at their school site to help build capacity in technology skills. Participants will also be able to share their knowledge at a district level through training days and conferences. Through this process, technology will be used in the entire instructional cycle from instruction to assessment in order to determine success.</P><br /><br /><P>Project Schools include:&nbsp; Santaluces Community High School, Palm Beach Central High School, Palm Beach Gardens High School, and South Tech Charter School. Two private schools are collaborating at the requirements of NCLB which are Saint Luke Catholic School and All Saints Catholic School.</P><h3>Recommendation:</h3><p>I recommend that the School Board approve the Title II, Part D - Enhancing Education Through Technology (EETT) Part II Competitive Grant in the amount of $212,580.75, effective through September 30, 2011, and authorize the Superintendent or his designee to sign all related documents and contracts that are required for the implementation of grant activities.</p><h3>Contact:</h3><p><P>Judith Klinek (<A href="mailto:klinek@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">klinek@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A>)</P><br /><br /><P>Dr. Alison Adler (<A href="mailto:aadler@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">aadler@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A>)</P><br /><br /><P>Gary Weidenhamer (<A href="mailto:gary.weidenhamer@palmbeachschools.org">gary.weidenhamer@palmbeachschools.org</A>)</P><br /><br /><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P><br /><br /><P>&nbsp;</P><br /><br /><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P></p><h3>Financial Impact:</h3><p>The financial impact to the Special Revenue-Other Funds Budget will be an increase of $212,580.75.
