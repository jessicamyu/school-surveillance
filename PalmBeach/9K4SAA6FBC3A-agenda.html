<div class="itembody"><P>On or about October 30, 2009, Jerold Self, a Civics Teacher, became the subject of an investigation based upon his discussion and distribution of inappropriate materials to his middle school civics class.&nbsp; The Principal of Independence&nbsp; Middle School, Lori Bonino, learned from a parent that Jerold Self discussed with his class a paper entitled "10 Simple Rules for Dating My Daughter".&nbsp; Mr. Self discussed this paper with his seventh grade students in class and provided some students with a copy of the paper.&nbsp; This paper included, among other things, a statement that reads:&nbsp; "I'm sure you've been told that in today's world, sex without utilizing a 'barrier method' of some kind can kill you.&nbsp; Let me elaborate:&nbsp; when it comes to sex, I am the barrier, and I will kill you".&nbsp; During the classroom discussion by Mr. Self, students held individual discussions with each other that included such comments as "penis and vagina".</P><br /><br /><P>Mr. Self's conduct resulted in allegations of gross insubordination, failure to exercise best professional judgment, inappropriate interaction with student(s), violation of School Board Policy 1.013(1), Responsibilities of the School District Personnel and Staff, violation of 6B-1.001(3), Florida, misconduct - willful disregard for policy/directive/rule, unprofessional conduct, and inappropriate language and/or behavior with or to students.</P><br /><br /><P>Mr. Self has previously been disciplined for similar behavior.&nbsp; On March 13, 2009, he received a Written Reprimand for making inappropriate comments to female students.&nbsp; Subsequently, two months later, he was again disciplined for similar behavior.&nbsp; According to student reports, Mr. Self used profanity inside the classroom and called students "pathetic" and "jackass".&nbsp; Mr. Self was also reported to have engaged in an inappropriate conversation about a female student hiding a cell phone inside her blouse, telling another student to "check down her shirt-- it's probably in there".&nbsp; Students further reported that Mr. Self regularly engages in inappropriate conversations during class time, reporting that Mr. Self told the class that his granddaughter could not wear the same type of clothes that he has seen the female students wear at Independence Middle School wearing (outside the school) because they would be looked upon in Nicaragua as whores and sluts.</P><br /><br /><P>On July 22, 2009, Mr. Self received a fifteen (15) day suspension, which was reduced to a five (5) day suspension pursuant to an agreement by the parties involved.</P><br /><br /><P>Mr. Self's behavior constitutes gross insubordination as he has intentionally refused and failed to adhere to the admonishments and directives to cease and desist from engaging in the same or similar conduct in the future.&nbsp; The school and the District have done diligence in their efforts to correct the behavior through the form of progressive discipline.&nbsp; All forms of progressive discipline have failed.&nbsp; Mr. Self continues to grossly and willfully disregard directives, policies and rules.</P><br /><br /><P>There is just cause to support the termination of Jerold Self.</P><h3>Recommendation:</h3><p>I recommend that the School Board approve Jerold Self's suspension without pay, effective immediately.&nbsp; I further recommend that the School Board approve the termination of Jerold Self's employment effective June 14, 2010 subject only to appeal under Section 120.569, Florida Statutes.</p><h3>Contact:</h3><p><P>James P.

<div class="itembody"><P>For approximately three years, the Mary and Robert Pew Public Education Fund has funded the workshop model in elementary schools across the district.&nbsp; They began by supporting professional development on Writer's Workshop in six Title I schools. The Mary and Robert Pew Public Education Fund&nbsp; has also funded professional development on Writer's Workshop for two years at the district level by funding four district staff members that provided ongoing school-based&nbsp; and area-based professional development to 40 Title I schools.&nbsp; </P><br /><br /><P>This Mary and Robert Pew Public Education Fund grant will support ongoing professional development for over 70 principals and assistant principals of Title I schools implementing Reader's and/or Writer's Workshop.&nbsp; Over 750 teachers in these schools are currently receiving professional development from Teacher's College as well as district staff members. The goal of this cohort is for administrators to sharpen their ability to provide high quality literacy support for their teachers implementing the workshop model.&nbsp;&nbsp; Administrators will visit each others' schools, work alongside each other in study groups, share tools for analyzing the teaching that occurs within and across grade levels, develop and refine tactics for rallying their communities, share strategies, and improve the quality of teaching and student learning.&nbsp; </P><br /><br /><P>The workshop model is a daily, structured time that involves explicit instruction and both guided and independent practice.&nbsp; Students are encouraged to be risk takers as they learn how reading and writing are connected by conversing, thinking and writing about personal and literature related experiences. Students are given the tools to select and comprehend literature, as well as collect, draft, revise, edit, and publish well-crafted narrative and informational texts.&nbsp; </P><br /><br /><P>The workshop model is the structure that New York City schools have implemented to successfully turn around high needs schools.&nbsp; New York City Department of Education research shows that from 2002 to 2008, the achievement gap for proficiency on the state-wide English Language Arts test between black and white fourth grade students closed 6.3 points.&nbsp; The achievement gap between Hispanic and white fourth grade students closed 6.2 points.&nbsp; Additional research shows that from 2006 to 2008, 13 out of 15 schools, specifically implementing the Lucy Calkins Units of Study writing curriculum, had a 3%-20% increase in student performance on this same assessment.&nbsp; </P><br /><br /><P>To assist in facilitating this process, this grant will fund a senior staff developer from Columbia University's Teachers College who will visit four times throughout the year and stay for two days each visit, one day for principals and one day for assistant principals.&nbsp; The staff developer is an administrator with the New York City School system, who has been instrumental in turning around high needs schools in NYC through support of the workshop model. Building capacity in administrators is the key to success with literacy instruction.</P><h3>Recommendation:</h3><p>I recommend that the School Board approve the Reader's and Writer's Workshop Administrative Cohort Grant in&nbsp; the amount of $21,800 to provide funding for ongoing professional development for principals and assistant principals of schools implementing Reader's and Writer's Workshop and authorize the Superintendent or designee to sign all documents and contracts related to the grant which are required for implementation of the grant activities for FY11 beginning February 25,&nbsp; 2010 and ending May 30, 2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Contact:</h3><p>Judith Klinek (<A href="mailto:klinek@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">klinek@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A>)<BR>Constance Tuman-Rugg (<A href="mailto:tuman@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">tuman@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A>)<BR>Liz Perlman (<A href="mailto:LizPerlman@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">LizPerlman@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A>)<BR></p><h3>Financial Impact:</h3><p>The financial impact to the district is an increase to revenue of $21,800 to support and maintain the Reader's and Writer's Workshop Administrative Cohort.&nbsp; All grant related expenditures and contracts are authorized for payment up to the amount of revenue.</p></div>

<div class="itembody"><P>For approximately three years, the Mary and Robert Pew Public Education Fund has funded the workshop model in elementary schools across the district.&nbsp; They began by supporting professional development on Writer's Workshop in six Title I schools. This Mary and Robert Pew Public Education Fund grant will provide one-year funding in the amount of $375,000 for professional development and four district staff members to continue assistance to 32 high needs schools implementing the Lucy Calkins Units of Study Writing Project.&nbsp; </P><br /><br /><P>Over the past two years, this grant has supported professional development to over 850 teachers who educate approximately 16,000 kindergarten through third grade students.&nbsp; The professional development involved study groups, modeling; one-on-one and in lab-sites, co-teaching, analyzing student writing to drive instruction, analyzing the teaching that occurs within and across grade levels, sharing strategies, and community building. Over a four year period, the district will implement the Units of Study Writing Curriculum in kindergarten through fifth grade in 32 Title I schools. These schools will become model teaching resources for other schools within and beyond our district.</P><br /><br /><P>Roll-out:<BR>&nbsp; FY09 The project was implemented in kindergarten through second grade<BR>&nbsp; FY10 The project was implemented in third grade <BR>&nbsp; FY11 The project will be implemented in fourth grade <BR>&nbsp; FY12 The project will be implemented in fifth grade <BR>&nbsp; FY13 The project will be continued in participating kindergarten through fifth grade classrooms and&nbsp;offered to other schools throughout the district</P><br /><br /><P>The four district staff members will work with participating schools to provide off-site monthly support meetings for lead teachers and on-site collaborative professional development for all teachers of their assigned schools. In order to build capacity across the district, they will also work with model schools to arrange for school visits and provide institutes for participating teachers from schools around the district.&nbsp; </P><br /><br /><P>The district staff will monitor implementation by making frequent visits to the schools participating in the writing project.&nbsp; Outcomes will be evaluated through data collected from the Palm Beach Writes, FCAT Writing Assessment, and pre and post writing assessments.&nbsp; These data sources will assist in tracking student data to determine an increase in students performing at or above grade level and a decrease in students performing below grade level.&nbsp; </P><br /><br /><P>As a result of the in-depth professional development provided by the four district staff members over the past two years, teachers in these 32 schools have sharpened their ability to provide high quality literacy instruction for their students. Through these hands-on experiences, we have improved the quality of teaching and increased student achievement.&nbsp;&nbsp; These teachers are becoming literacy leaders in their schools and throughout the district.&nbsp; <BR></P><h3>Recommendation:</h3><p>I&nbsp; recommend that the School Board approve the Lucy Calkins Units of Study Writing Project Grant in the amount of $375,000 to provide continued funding for professional development and four current district staff members and authorize the Superintendent or designee to sign all documents and contracts related to the grant which are required for implementation of the grant activities for FY11 beginning June 1, 2010 and ending May 30, 2011.</p><h3>Contact:</h3><p><P>Judith Klinek (<A href="mailto:klinek@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">klinek@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A>)<BR>Constance Tuman-Rugg (<A href="mailto:tuman@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">tuman@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A>)<BR>Liz Perlman (<A href="mailto:LizPerlman@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">LizPerlman@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A>)</P></p><h3>Financial Impact:</h3><p>The financial impact to the district is an increase to revenue of $375,000 to support and maintain the Lucy Calkins Units of Study Writing Project.&nbsp; All grant related expenditures and contracts are authorized for payment up to the amount of revenue.</p></div>
