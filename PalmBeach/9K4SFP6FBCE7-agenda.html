<div class="itembody"><P>The High School Graduation Initiative provides funding to reduce dropout rates in schools that exceeded the state average dropout rates from 2007-2008 according to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). The grant requires effective, research-based programs for youth at risk of dropping out and for those who have already dropped out. Four high schools with dropout rates that exceeded the state average of 3.3% are targeted to receive the My Grad Plan. The schools are: Forest Hill, John I. Leonard, Palm Beach Lakes, and Boynton Beach Community High Schools. These four schools were the only schools in our District that met the narrow eligibility requirements in the grant application. The purpose of the project is to graduate students college and/or career ready. The goals of the project are 1) to increase the graduation rates at each of the four project high schools and 2) to reduce the dropout rate at these schools.</P><br /><br /><P>The project's effective early identification, prevention, and intervention research-based strategies include use of data for evaluation/redirection; individualized personal connection with adult advocates; targeted academic support; career and workplace instruction; and behavioral, social and emotional supports. </P><br /><br /><P>The School District of Palm Beach County is the lead agent for this grant.&nbsp; My Grad Plan is a collaboration between the School District, Palm Beach State College, Workforce Alliance, Take Stock in Children, Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID), and the Community Partnership Group.&nbsp; The partners provide workforce instruction, college preparation, mentoring, summer transition, and other services. </P><br /><br /><P>The impact of the project will be measured in increased graduation rates at the schools and decreased dropout rates. </P><br /><br /><P>A copy of the grant is in the Board Office for review.</P><h3>Recommendation:</h3><p>I recommend that the School Board approve the receipt of&nbsp; the High School Graduation Initiative Project from&nbsp; the U.S. Department of Education for up to $9,700,000 from October 1, 2010 through September 30, 2015, and authorize the Superintendent or designee to sign all documents and contracts related to the grant which are required for implementation of the grant activities.</p><h3>Contact:</h3><p><P>Ann Killets (<A href="mailto:akillets@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">akillets@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A>)</P><br /><br /><P>Alison Adler&nbsp; </P></p><h3>Financial Impact:</h3><p>The financial impact to the Special Revenue-Other Funds Budget is an increase of up to $9,700,000 over five years.&nbsp; All project related expenditures and contracts are authorized for payment up to the amount of revenue. There is no financial impact to the Operating Budget.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div>
