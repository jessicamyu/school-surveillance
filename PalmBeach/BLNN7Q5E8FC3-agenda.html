Many of these students have not experienced academic success at the traditional school. NorthStar Academy is founded on the belief that, given the option to participate in an innovative, student-centered learning environment that combines teacher-directed and technology-based instruction, every student has the potential to succeed in school, earn a standard high school diploma, and be prepared for post-secondary studies or careers.  The School is committed to helping students realize their dreams of becoming self-sufficient, contributing members of society so that they can lead productive, fulfilling lives. NorthStar Academy will offer credit accrual and acceleration in an academic environment that features both life-skills mentoring and teacher-directed instruction, which will be carried out by qualified and highly-committed teachers in one-to-one, small group, or whole group settings.  Each student will be assessed, assigned to one of the “Learning Labs” (online instruction) and scheduled for “Direct Instruction” (DI) with state-certified teachers. Teacher-directed lessons (in DI classrooms) will address the specific learning needs of each student, based on real-time student performance data, through the use of research-based programs and strategies that are designed to promote student mastery of state standards. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

The Framework is structured around planning and assessment processes, pedagogy, the culture and climate of learning, and the foundations of quality teaching. Teachers will participate in professional development throughout the year on the Achievement Framework. NorthStar Academy will apply the comprehensive framework to ensure excellence in education and effective implementation of the EdisonLearning Bridgescape Model.

DI Classrooms will be equipped with an interactive whiteboard (or projector and screen) to allow teachers to use technology to enhance instruction. All students in grades 9-12 who have not met the ELA requirement for graduation, and students in grades 6-8 who have not met proficiency in ELA, will be required to complete daily lessons in Reading Plus, a research-based, supplementary online reading program. Students in grades 6-12 who require additional support in mathematics will use online supplementary programs such as Accelerated Math (Renaissance) and/or Study Island (Edmentum) which are designed to improve students’ conceptual knowledge and skills in order to master state standards. Online resources will be utilized by teachers during direct instruction that may include ReadWorks, Math Nation/Algebra Nation, Khan Academy, ReadTheory, and other resources related to science and social studies. Students taking Intensive Reading will use research-based core materials during teacher-directed instruction. The core curriculum for Intensive Reading will be National Geographic Learning’s Hampton-Brown Edge (for grades 9-12) and National Geographic Learning’s Inside (for grades 6-8). Students requiring more intensive instruction will also utilize Voyager Sopris Learning’s REWARDS-Secondary. The School may adopt different research-based supplementary and intervention programs in the future based on district recommendations and program success rates. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

Since 1986, the National Dropout Prevention Center (NDPC) has conducted and analyzed research; sponsored workshops and national conferences; and collaborated with researchers, policymakers, and practitioners to further the mission of reducing America’s dropout rate by meeting the needs of youth in at-risk situations, including students with disabilities. NDPC has identified 15 Effective Strategies that have the most positive impact on reducing school dropout. NorthStar Academy has incorporated much of this research to develop a comprehensive educational program designed to meet the needs of a targeted group of students. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

The School will create an individualized instructional plan for each student upon enrollment. NorthStar Academy’s educational program will also incorporate non-academic components that have been shown to have a positive impact on student learning for student populations such as the one that will be served by the School. NorthStar Academy will provide wraparound services that include individualized student mentoring; support services to address the social, emotional, and mental well-being of each student; and college/career guidance and preparation.

The blended approach provides expanded counseling, tutoring, and support services including face-to-face contact with teachers, who provide not only subject-area support, but also guidance on effective study skills. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li style="margin-bottom:7.5pt"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="background:white"><span style="color:#333333"><span style="line-height:normal"><span helvetica="">Online courses can motivate students who have failed in the traditional classroom settings, as they can now learn at their own pace with the one-on-one help of an instructor. Students’ individual learning preferences and interests can be integrated and curriculum can be adapted to meet the students’ needs in online courses, which may make them more engaging to some students than traditional face-to-face classes. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

Diagnostic testing allows students to proceed once mastery is demonstrated. Personalized content selections and activities can offer multiple support options for those who need specific help and to keep students engaged. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

Multiple research studies document the social and emotional benefits that middle school students receive through mentoring programs, especially those students at risk of not completing high school (Komosa-Hawkins, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00940771.2017.1243919" target="_blank"><span style="color:#337ab7">2012</span></a>). Research findings about mentoring programs suggest that mentoring programs focusing on building strong and meaningful relationships between mentor and mentee may have the greatest benefit to adolescents (Larose et al., <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00940771.2017.1243919" target="_blank"><span style="color:#337ab7">2010</span></a>). Every student at NorthStar Academy in grades 6-12 will be assigned an adult mentor who will work with them on a weekly basis to support their academic, social, and emotional growth. Mentors will establish a close relationship with student mentees in an effort to provide them with the academic and social-emotional guidance needed to meet individualized short-term and long-term goals. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:7.5pt"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="background:white"><span style="line-height:normal"><span helvetica=""><span style="color:#333333">As shown through research studies, students in the middle and high school grades who fit the profile of the “student at risk of dropping out” benefit greatly when schools place an emphasis on meeting their social-emotional needs. Research indicates that social and emotional learning (SEL) programs assist students not only in dealing with daily struggles, but also increase students' academic skills. In a research study on closing the achievement gap for African American and Latino students, Miranda et al (2007) cite several studies that concluded that the implementation of an SEL program among minority students significantly increased posttest scores in both reading and mathematics. Another research study (Bradley, 2013) cited evidence that these types of programs can “help level the playing field for historically underperforming students, raising their achievement and academic success levels to a degree that makes postsecondary education and advanced technical training a viable option with substantially increased probabilities of success.” NorthStar Academy recognizes that in order to help the School’s at-risk students to succeed; it must address not only the students’ academic deficits, but also provide them with social and emotional support. Goleman (2004) states that scientific data has demonstrated that SEL programs are effective in helping young people face problems and address life’s challenges. According to Goleman, SEL programs not only help students deal with difficult life issues but they also facilitate academic learning. Goleman cites research studies that provide evidence of the connection between SEL programs and academic success. NorthStar Academy will require all students to take the Life Skills eCourse which explores skills including conflict resolution, time management, team building, health and wellness, budgeting, speaking and listening, and other soft skills. Mentors will receive training on working with students to address their social-emotional needs. The School’s social worker will work with staff to identify students who may have a need for mental health services. The School will implement a Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) curriculum to provide students at all grade levels with information and coping skills that will help them deal with the struggles and challenges they face on a daily basis. NorthStar Academy will use the Scholar Centric resiliency survey and curriculum, Success Highways, for students in grades 6-10 to identify students with social emotional needs and provide appropriate interventions before students experience the negative impact of academic failure. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

This model helps make the transition from school to work easier for young people. Stone (2004) has identified several program techniques that keep students in school: career guidance, work-based learning, career pathways, and tech prep. Career guidance is an important element in keeping students in school. Career pathways often take the form of Career Academies. These are often schools-within-schools that are focused around a specific career area. Coursework includes academic and vocational classes. Kemple and Snipes (2000) found that enrollment in a career academy significantly decreased the dropout rate of at-risk students. Tech prep is similar to career pathways, but it is directly connected to postsecondary education. In its efforts to assist students in achieving their post-secondary career goals, NorthStar Academy will strive to enhance its Career Academies throughout the term of the charter by partnering with local colleges, universities, and technical/vocational schools. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
