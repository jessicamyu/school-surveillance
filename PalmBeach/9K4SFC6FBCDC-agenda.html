<div class="itembody"><P>Florida Congressman Alcee Hastings recently recognized Wynnebrook Elementary School in the House of Representatives.&nbsp; On March 19, 2012 Congressman Hastings honored the West Palm Beach elementary school and the following was entered into the Congressional Record.<BR>" Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Wynnebrook Elementary, a school in my district that exemplifies all that is right with America's public education system. Under the guidance of Principal Jeffrey Pegg and his talented faculty, Wynnebrook has been rated an ``A'' school by the State of Florida nine years in a row.<BR>" I toured this fine school on March 15, 2012 and saw for myself everything that makes it great. I met wonderful teachers and spoke to classroom after classroom of happy children who were clearly excited to learn.<BR>" Wynnebrook Elementary's students are overwhelmingly minority children, and most come from low-income families. Despite these challenges, writing scores on the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT) are in the 90th percentile, with reading scores close behind. Scores in nearly all core subjects are over 80 percent as well.<BR>" There is no lack of enthusiasm at Wynnebrook. Several teachers were eager to tell me how pleased they are with the continued excellence of Wynnebrook. They are certainly a large part of its success, with several having taught at Wynnbrook for over 30 years. Additionally, the children were eager to ask me questions about my occupation and career. I was especially impressed with the number of students who told me they would like to become doctors or lawyers.<BR>" Wynnebrook is proof that when schools get the funding they need, they will turn out intelligent, well-adjusted children who want to succeed in life. What I saw that day served as a reminder of the importance of Title I funding in ensuring that our nation's students receive the education they deserve, regardless of their financial background, and reinforced my determination to work for increased funding for public education as a whole.<BR>" Mr. Speaker, I commend Principal Pegg, reading instructor Leslie Millar, and all the fine teachers and staff members I met at Wynnebrook Elementary, and I look forward to even greater success from its administrators, faculty, and students in the years to come.</P><br /><br /><P>The Congressional Record is the official record of the proceedings and debates of the United States Congress.&nbsp; It is published by the United States Government Printing Office.&nbsp; It is issued daily when the United States Congress is in session.&nbsp; The Congressional Record was first published in 1873.&nbsp; </P><h3>Contact:</h3><p><P>Nat Harrington<BR><A href="mailto:nat.harrington@palmbeachschools.org">nat.harrington@palmbeachschools.org</A></P><br /><br /><P>Vickie Middlebrooks</P></p><h3>Financial Impact:</h3><p>None</p></div>

<div class="itembody"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These are two separate policies, although they must be purchased together. The first policy is the Student Catastrophic Accident Insurance policy which provides coverage of up to $5 million with a $25,000 per student deductible. This is required coverage for the District's participation in the Florida High School Activities Association (FHSAA) for sanctioned sports and covers medical expenses resulting from accidental injuries to any student while participating in school activities (including daytime activities). &nbsp;The terms and conditions have been reduced slightly. &nbsp;The benefit period for injuries covered under the catastrophic policy will be reduced from lifetime to 10 years while keeping the disability benefit at 20 years. &nbsp;This benefit change is due to the overall insurance market's desire to eliminate the lifetime benefit option from all similar policies due to the increased cost of reinsurance. &nbsp;The District has not had a claim requiring medical treatment beyond three (3) years. &nbsp;This benefit change and a reduction in claim experience will result in an overall premium reduction of five (5) percent (over $75,600). The premium for this policy will be reduced to $165,685.</font> <br /><br /><div><font size="2"><br></font></div><br /><br /><div><font size="2" face="Verdana">The second policy is the High School Interscholastic Athletic plan. This policy covers up to $25,000 in medical expenses for accidental injuries to high school interscholastic athletes and cheerleaders. As of last year, the FHSAA also requires some type of student accident insurance in order to participate in FHSAA sanctioned events. &nbsp;The premium will remain at $1,271,000.</font></div><br /><br /><div><font size="2"><br><font face="Verdana"></font></font></div><br /><br /><div><font size="2" face="Verdana">Student insurance fees, as allowed by School Board Policy 5.60 cover approximately half of the premium. &nbsp;The current fee is set at $75.00 per student.</font></div><h3>Recommendation:</h3><p><font size="3"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'; FONT-SIZE: medium"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I recommend the School Board renew the purchase of the High School Interscholastic Athletic Insurance and Student Catastrophic Accident Insurance, effective August 1, 2012 to August 1, 2013 from the Monumental Life Insurance Company (General Agent: &nbsp;Bollinger Insurance) for a combined total premium of $1,436,685.</font></span> </font></p><h3>Contact:</h3><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Michael J.

<div class="itembody"><P>PS 1 The consultant will perform the following services: </P><br /><br /><P>Manage the operations of the Lake Worth Community High School's Flea Market.&nbsp; Organize and supervise vendors and shoppers, maintain appropriate financial records and reports, facilitate set up and break down of vendor stations, clean and secure all parking areas to include gates at closing time, meet with Principal and Bookkeeper to address issues as they present themselves.&nbsp; </P><br /><br /><P>Lake Worth High School uses the flea market as a fund raiser to promote student achievement. A percentage of the funds raised is donated directly to LWHS Dollars for Scholars Foundation, which is managed by&nbsp;the Alumni Association. Flea Market funds are used to pay SAT/ACT registration fees and college application fees for students who are unable to afford it.&nbsp; Lake Worth High has a unique student population where many of the families are low-income.&nbsp; The funds raised by the flea market assist students by expanding their access to higher education opportunities.&nbsp; </P><br /><br /><P>The flea market benefits the district by increasing graduation rates and offering more opportunities for students to excel once they have graduated.</P><br /><br /><P>After all expenses to run the Flea Market such as Ralph Milone's pay, school police security, custodial costs, any operating expenses, etc. are paid, the remaining&nbsp;funds are turned over to the school and are used to further student achievement by funding student scholarships, pay ACT/SAT registration and college applications.&nbsp; Currently the ratio is about 40% -50% of flea market sales going to expenses of running the flea market and 50% - 60% given back to the school to be used for student achievement. All District Financial guidelines are followed.&nbsp; A yearly audit of internal funds assures that the vendor is keeping accurate records.<BR></P><h3>Recommendation:</h3><p>I recommend award of the Professional Services Agreement with Ralph J.

<div class="itembody"><P>Approve 31 day extension of RFP 07C-006B For Nursing Services</P><br /><br /><P>The original contract for this RFP was awarded by Board action on June 27, 2007, for five (5) years beginning July 1, 2007. The RFP allows the contract to be extended up to 90 days if it is in the best interest of the district to do so. The contract was awarded to All Metro Home Care Services of Florida, Inc., Just For Kids, Inc. and Maxim Healthcare Services, Inc.</P><br /><br /><P>Just For Kids, Inc. withdrew their proposal and chose not to participate in this contract.</P><br /><br /><P>Services to be provided include nursing services to individual students whose medical needs are so severe as to require a nurse while at school in accordance with state and federal guidelines. Services are provided by Registered Nurses, Licensed Practical Nurses, Visiting Nurses and Certified Nurse Assistants. Services also include training for District staff on procedures such as tube feeding, catheterization, seizure precautions, etc. </P><br /><br /><P>It has been determined that it is in the best interest of the District to extend these services with the current contracted vendors for an additional thirty-one (31) days beyond the contract expiration date. This will allow the students receiving services at the beginning of the Extended School Year, Summer Camp and Afterschool to continue to receive services by the same caregiver until the end of these classes and camps.&nbsp; </P><br /><br /><P>&nbsp;</P><h3>Recommendation:</h3><p>I recommend approval of the thirty-one day extension of RFP 07C-006B for Nursing Services in the amount of $165,000 for the period of July 1, 2012 through July 31, 2012.</p><h3>Contact:</h3><p>Michael J.

As part of the modernization project approval process, the City of West Palm Beach Historical Preservation Board required the School District to rehabilitate the exterior of Building #4. The Phase 3 Guaranteed Maximum Price included funds to rehabilitate the exterior and renovate the interior of Building #4. During the demolition of the interior of Building #4, numerous unforeseen structural deficiencies were identified and the work was put on hold. CORC was provided an update and they recommended that staff explore other options with the City including demolition. Staff met with the City on multiple occasions and the outcome was that the Historical Preservation Board still requires the exterior of the building to be rehabilitated.</FONT></FONT></DIV><br /><br /><LI><br /><br /><DIV align=justify><FONT size=2><FONT color=#000000><STRONG>Estimated Construction Cost:</STRONG> The total estimated construction cost for Building #4 is $1,800,000.&nbsp; The Modernization project has $1,100,000 available for building 4.&nbsp; The proposed FY 2013-2017 Five-Year Plan includes an additional $700,000.&nbsp; Facilities Services plans to request two bid prices from each bidder for Building #4.&nbsp; One for interior/exterior renovation and the structural repairs.&nbsp; The other for just exterior renovation and structural repairs.&nbsp; If the bids for interior/exterior renovation and structural renovations are within the $1,800,000 budget, a contract will be issued based on this scope of work.&nbsp; If the bids for the interior/exterior renovation and structural repairs are over the budget, a contract will be issued only for the exterior renovation and structural repairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR></FONT></FONT></DIV></LI></UL><h3>Recommendation:</h3><p><P align=justify><FONT color=#000000 size=2>I recommend the School Board approve a Project Modification in the amount of $63,410.00 to BRPH Architect-Engineers, Inc. for the Northboro Elementary School Modernization Project #0291-8504, and authorize the Chairman and Superintendent to finalize and execute all related contract documents.</FONT></P></p><h3>Contact:</h3><p><FONT size=2><FONT color=#000000>Joseph M.
