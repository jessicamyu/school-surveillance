(2) Establish inter-local agreements to allow after-hours use of schools' recreation facilities throughout the target area. (3) Promote community safety that encourages children and families to participate in outdoor physical activity and recreation. (4) Establish community gardens, farmer's markets, and other retail initiatives, including partnerships among food retailers, local farmers and community garden programs to increase access to fresh fruits/vegetables for vulnerable children and their families.</LI></UL><br /><br /><P>&nbsp;</P><h3>Recommendation:</h3><p><P>I recommend that the School Board accepts the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Healthy Kids, Healthy Communities Grant for four years effective December 3, 2009 in the amount of $360,000 and authorize the Superintendent or designee to sign all documents and contracts related to the grant which are implementation of the grant activities, focusing on obesity among the Hispanic community.</P><br /><br /><P>Staff advises that this item&nbsp;was added to the agenda after the first publication because:</P><br /><br /><UL><br /><br /><LI>On November 20, 2009 the School District of Palm Beach County was asked by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to sign their grant Letter of Agreement.</LI><br /><br /><LI>In order to start the grant on December 15, 2009, the individuals listed on the Letter of Agreement must sign it and return one original signed copy to the address below no later than December 4, 2009.</LI><br /><br /><LI>If the Letter of Agreement is received by the Foundation after the deadline, then the start date would be be delayed.</LI><br /><br /><LI>The School District's Legal Services department has reviewed and approved the Letter of Agreement received by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.</LI><br /><br /><LI>Many partners that collaborate with the School District's Wellness Promotional Policy have pledged good cause financial contributions to help promote healthy eating habits and physical activity.</LI></UL><br /><br /><P>This was added to the on line agenda Monday afternoon November 30th, which is sufficient notice.</P></p><h3>Contact:</h3><p><P>Jeffrey J.
