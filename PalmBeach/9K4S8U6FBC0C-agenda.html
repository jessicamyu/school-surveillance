<div class="itembody"><P>In the past four years, the School&nbsp; Board of Palm Beach County approved Statements of Work that authorized CORE K12 Education, formerly know as The Princeton Review, to provide assessments based on the Sunshine State Standards and real-time student results.&nbsp; These assessments and results are a critical part of the instructional process.&nbsp; They provide feedback to adjust ongoing teaching and learning to improve student mastery of end-of-year standards.</P><br /><br /><P>The current Statement of Work (SOW) enables the District to provide new assessments based on the Next Generation Sunshine State Standards (NGSSS) benchmarks and to continue to provide real-time student results to our key stakeholders (students, parents, teachers, and administrators).&nbsp; Specifically, this SOW enables CORE K12 Education to provide students and teachers:</P><br /><br /><UL><br /><br /><LI>27,000 items focused on NGSSS benchmarks using the Assessment Center (ASC) <br /><br /><LI>1350 mini assessments focused on NGSSS benchmarks using ASC <br /><br /><LI>Real-time results on items and mini assessments delivered through the Web, by scanners, and by clickers using ASC <br /><br /><LI>25 winter diagnostic assessments, including two diagnostic assessments aligned to the Algebra End-of-Course examinations, focused on NGSSS benchmarks <br /><br /><LI>Service, support, professional development, and community outreach through CORE K12 Education program management</LI></UL><br /><br /><P>Summary of the Development of the current SOW:</P><br /><br /><UL><br /><br /><LI>In FY11, teachers in nearly all classes will teach NGSSS that will be assessed by FCAT 2.0. <br /><br /><LI>The District's current set of assessments (except the fall diagnostic assessments), are aligned to the Sunshine State Standards (SSS), and need to be replaced with a set of assessments that are aligned to the NGSSS. <br /><br /><LI>The NGSSS&nbsp;assessment results need to continue to be available in real-time. <br /><br /><LI>Research, best practices, accreditation, professional standards, and Differentiated Accountability&nbsp;in Florida strongly support the use of a comprehensive and balanced assessment system that includes aligned assessments and a real-time collection/reporting system. <br /><br /><LI>The District determined that it could not produce and provide the NGSSS winter diagnostic assessments, a real-time item bank, and mini-assessment results in a timely manner.&nbsp; Further, the Florida Department of Education has no plans to do so for FY11. <br /><br /><LI>On January 8, 2010, the District issued an Invitation to Negotiate (ITN) to obtain assessments that are aligned to the NGSSS and have real-time results.&nbsp; The ITN was based on feedback received during the first semester from teachers, administrators, and parents. <br /><br /><LI>On February 16, 2010, the ITN Committee, composed of principals and central-office administrators, agreed that the CORE K12 Education proposal best matched the criteria of the ITN. <br /><br /><LI>The District and CORE K12 Education negotiated a SOW based on suggestions made by teachers and administrators at a February 26, 2010, meeting concerning how to improve the District's curriculum and assessment system. <br /><br /><LI>The SOW has been designed to provide a cost-effective, flexible, comprehensive and balanced assessment system that contains NGSSS individual test items, already-constructed NGSSS tests, and a collection/reporting system that provides real-time results.&nbsp; As a result of this design: <br /><br /><UL><br /><br /><LI>schools will have flexibility to develop a testing schedule that is based on school and student needs <br /><br /><LI>District and differentiated accountability schools will be able to meet differentiated accountability assessment requirements <br /><br /><LI>non-differentiated accountability schools will have access to CORE K12 Education <br /><br /><LI>all schools will participate in the District's winter diagnostic assessments <br /><br /><LI>schools' technical (i.e., hardware and software) difficulties will be addressed</LI></UL><br /><br /><LI>The total cost of implementing the current SOW in all schools is $1,316,488.&nbsp; In comparison, if the District provided the same deliverables it would cost $4,911,322.&nbsp; Therefore the total savings in FY11 would be $3,594,835. <br /><br /><LI>The Comprehensive Research Based Reading Program Grant will provide $325,000 for the SOW <br /><br /><LI>The current SOW will provide the District and schools with a critical tool - a tool that is essential for improving student achievement.</LI></UL><br /><br /><P>&nbsp;</P><h3>Recommendation:</h3><p><P>I recommend that the School Board approve the Statement of Work to be implemented in all Correct II and Prevent II schools in the amount of $773,337, a project contingency fund in the amount of $543,151 for non-Correct II and non-Prevent II schools, which opt to participate, and a project contingency fund in the amount of $40,000 for unforeseen expenses.</P></p><h3>Contact:</h3><p><P>Ann Killets <A href="mailto:akillets@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">akillets@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A></P><br /><br /><P>Marc Baron</P><br /><br /><P>Bill Thompson</P></p><h3>Financial Impact:</h3><p>The financial impact to the FY11 General Fund budget will not exceed $1,031,488.&nbsp;
