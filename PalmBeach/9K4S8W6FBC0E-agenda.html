<div class="itembody"><P>In April of 2010, Sherron Brown, Assistant Food Service I of Palm Beach Gardens Community High School, became the subject of an Employee Relations investigation based on allegations of misuse of District funds, failure to exercise best professional judgment and misconduct-willful disregard for policy/directive/rule.&nbsp; Sherron Brown's allegations also include potential violations of School Board Policy 1.013(1) Responsibilities of the School District Personnel and Staff.</P><br /><br /><P>A two (2) day surveillance of Ms. Brown's cash register transactions was initiated based upon a report of suspected misappropriation of funds.&nbsp; This computerized surveillance allowed for the real time tracking of transactions identifying the student making the purchase, the amount of the purchase (when not voided) and the time of the purchase.&nbsp; Based upon the surveillance records, Ms. Brown had a high number of purchases in which the student pin number was entered but the transaction was "cleared" or "voided", as if the purchase never occurred.&nbsp; Some of the students, who were identified through this surveillance process, were interviewed and stated that they made a cash purchase of items from the cafeteria on the noted dates and times where "voids" or "cleared" transactions appeared.&nbsp; A review of Ms. Brown's daily activity shows an extraordinary amount of these no sale transactions.&nbsp; A prior incident in 2005 by Ms. Brown was reported to School Police and resulted in conferencing from her Principal regarding the proper handling of money at the register.</P><br /><br /><P>Based upon substantial information gathered during the investigation, there is sufficient evidence to substantiate the above allegations and to support the suspension.</P><h3>Recommendation:</h3><p>I recommend that the School Board approve Sherron Brown's suspension without pay, effective October 15, 2010 subject only to appeal under Section 120.569, Florida Statutes.</p><h3>Contact:</h3><p><P>Sonia Hill-Howard, Director</P><br /><br /><P>James P.
