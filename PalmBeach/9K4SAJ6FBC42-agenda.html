<div class="itembody"><P align=justify>UB Kinsey/Palmview&nbsp;School of the Arts Elementary has a long-standing choice program that creates opportunities for students to learn concentrations in band, vocal, digital media, drama, dance, movement, visual arts, strings, piano, TV productions, and percussion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Students, parents, and community members value this choice program as one of the only elementary Arts schools in the&nbsp;northern part of the District.&nbsp; In order to provide the extended learning opportunities in the Arts, a waiver and contract with CTA is attached to extend the school day by one-half hour for students and teachers in order to provide students with these core concentration courses.</P><br /><br /><P align=justify>The waiver&nbsp;supports: 100%&nbsp;of School Improvement goals, 100% of School Advisory Council, 100% approval of the instructional staff, and FCAT Test results for&nbsp;2010 (see data panel).</P><br /><br /><P align=justify>The waiver was voted on by the School Advisory Council, and by the school faculty in a silent vote.&nbsp; The waiver was submitted and approved by the&nbsp;District's School Waiver Committee for recommendation.&nbsp;&nbsp;The School District Waiver Committee has considered and determined that the following factors exists, as set forth within School Board Policy 2.09, Paragraph 7:&nbsp; 1) The waiver is possible without incurring inconsistency with State Statute or State Board of Education rules;&nbsp; 2) the waiver is focused on maximizing student outcomes; and 3) the waiver is based on research and best practices.</P><br /><br /><P align=justify>A key outcome expected to continue from the extended-day schedule is an increase in the performance of students on the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test.</P><h3>Recommendation:</h3><p><P align=justify>I recommend that through SB Policy 8.01, the School Board approve a waiver request from U.B. Kinsey Elementary School to waive SB Policy 2.36 (Length of School Days); and further, that through the process contained in SB Policy 2.09 (Paragraph 8) and through SB Policy 3.01, the School Board approve the continuation of the Memorandum of Understanding between CTA and the School District of Palm Beach County to waive Article III, Section B (1) of the Collective Bargaining Agreement to allow the continuation of the 30 minute extended school day at U.B.

<div class="itembody"><P>The Adult Education and Family Literacy grant is a grant in the amount of $1,672,244. The program performance dates of this grant are July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2012. </P><br /><br /><P>The purpose of this grant is to facilitate the improvement and expansion of adult basic education programs including family literacy and workplace literacy. Programs for adults are provided to foster literacy development, lifelong learning and community involvement and development. The elements of this grant relate to the administration of adult education and family literacy programs for the development of basic and functional literacy skills, workplace literacy, and family literacy services. </P><br /><br /><P>In addition, this grant will provide adult education and literacy services in order to: </P><br /><br /><P>1. Assist adults in becoming literate and obtaining the knowledge and skills necessary for employment and self-sufficiency. </P><br /><br /><P>2. Assist adults who are parents in obtaining the education skills necessary to become full partners in the educational development of their children. </P><br /><br /><P>3. Assist adults in completing high school or the equivalent. </P><br /><br /><P>4. Assist adults to enter postsecondary education without the need for developmental courses. </P><br /><br /><P>Grant funds will also be used for personnel, staff development, instructional hardware, software, videos, and distance learning tools and materials to support the goals of this grant. </P><br /><br /><P>Adult Education programs are provided at 25 adult and community schools, one full-time adult education center, and numerous satellite programs located throughout Palm Beach County. These programs are offered at various times throughout the day and evening in order to accommodate student needs and schedules. </P><br /><br /><P>The term "adult education" means services or instruction below the postsecondary level for individuals who have attained 16 years of age; who are not enrolled or required to be enrolled in secondary school under State law; who lack sufficient mastery of basic educational skills to enable the individuals to function effectively in society; do not have a secondary school diploma or its recognized equivalent and have not achieved an equivalent level of education; or are unable to speak, read, or write the English language. </P><br /><br /><P>To ensure continuous improvement of this adult education grant, student progress will be measured by progression through Literacy Completion Points (LCPs). The Adult General Education program or course numbers and associated LCPs are used to document improvements in literacy performance standards. LCPs represent a student's attainment of an Education Function Level gain in adult federal reportable programs. These tracing measures must be used by all adult education programs for all enrolled students to ensure compliance in reporting.</P><h3>Recommendation:</h3><p>I recommend that the School Board approve the Adult Education and Family Literacy - Adult General Education Grant from the Department of Education in the amount of $1,672,244 effective July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2012 and authorize the Superintendent or designee to sign all documents and contracts related to the grant which are required for implementation of the grant activities.</p><h3>Contact:</h3><p><P>Judith Klinek (<A href="mailto:klinek@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">klinek@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A>)</P><br /><br /><P>Constance Tuman-Rugg, Ed.D.

<div class="itembody">There are two actions in this item: 1) Agree to notify the Palm Beach Convention Center of the District's intention to cancel the 3rd year of the 3-year contract for high school graduations for 2012. * A comparison estimate was completed which shows that there is a significant cost savings to switch 2012 graduation site to the County Fairgrounds * Included in the attachments are the original convention center contract with legal review checklist and a Comparison Estimate Graph of the savings 2. Approve the confirmation of the South Florida Expo Center at the Palm Beach County Fairgrounds for Spring 2012 Graduation. * The attached County Fairgrounds contract includes: - Rental of building space - Audio visual - Personnel charges - Facility equipment and fees - Emergency medical, Sheriff or Police - Ticketing fees<h3>Recommendation:</h3><p>1. I recommend that the Board agrees to cancel the 3rd year of the 3-year contract with Palm Beach County Convention Center and authorize the superintendent or designee to sign all documents and contracts required. 2. I recommend that the School Board approve the confirmation of the South Florida Expo Center at the Palm Beach County Fairgrounds to hold the 2012 spring high school graduation ceremonies and authorize the superintendent or designee to sign all documents and contracts required.</p><h3>Contact:</h3><p>Judith Klinek (klinek@palmbeach.k12.fl.us) Dr. Constance Tuman-Rugg</p><h3>Financial Impact:</h3><p>The financial impact of the Palm Beach County Fairgrounds contract is $122,609.20 from the general fund; however, after additional costs for the services highlighted in the comparison chart, the total cost of 2012 graduations will be $150,126.20.</p></div>
