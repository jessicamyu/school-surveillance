<div class="itembody"><P>Frances Carter is a former educator with the School District, a pillar of the community, an advocate for youth and an activist for civil rights.&nbsp; She attended school at S.D. Spady Elementary, Carver High School and graduated with a Bachelor of Science Degree with a Major in Science from Barber-Scotia College in Concord, North Carolina, she also attended Florida Atlantic University.&nbsp; Mrs. Carter began her teaching career during a volatile time in 1965 at S.D. Spady Elementary; after her first year, she was one of two blacks reassigned to Addison-Mizner Elementary in Boca Raton to integrate staff in 1967.&nbsp; She taught at Addison-Mizner Elementary for 21 years, during which time Mrs. Carter served on the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools for the accreditation and review of schools in St. Lucie County.&nbsp; She transferred to Carver Middle School for two years where she started a drop-out prevention program; then, Omni Middle where she worked until she retired in 1999.&nbsp; </P><br /><br /><P>In 1974, Mrs. Carter started tutoring neighborhood children in her home. She eventually moved to her uncle's garage as well as a large room at the police substation on 12th Avenue to support the growing group as the program gained more publicity, hence inaugurating SMART (Spelling, Math, And Reading Tutoring).&nbsp; Mrs. Carter applied for and received a small grant from Children Services Council of Palm Beach County in 1993 and relocated her growing program to the Masonic Building where it was divided into two groups, Elementary and Middle/High School.&nbsp; In 1997, SMART joined MAD DADS (Men Against Destruction, Defending Against Drugs and Social Disorder) of Greater Delray Beach and with the assistance of their staff, was incorporated and became Children Learning After School Session (C.L.A.S.S.) of Palm Beach County, Inc., which was made up of 12 people including retired and current teachers, high school students and retired employees of the school system.&nbsp; Financial assistance from the School Board of Palm Beach County permitted C.L.A.S.S. to expand, benefiting students that attended the program with significant improvements in reading and math test scores, grades, students achieving honor roll and an increase in students going to college and graduating as a testament to its success.</P><h3>Contact:</h3><p><P>Judith Klinek<BR><A href="mailto:klinek@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">klinek@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A></P><br /><br /><P>Nat Harrington</P><br /><br /><P>Vickie Middlebrooks</P></p><h3>Financial Impact:</h3><p>None</p></div>

<div class="itembody"><P>May is Haitian Heritage Month and students, schools, and the Haitian community will be celebrating with a number of exciting educational and cultural programs and events. A student essay contest was organized by the School District Haitian Heritage Month Committee and sponsored by the Gaskov Clergé Foundation, a community organization whose mission is to enhance the health, welfare and education of families and children in need in Haiti and in the communities overseas.&nbsp;&nbsp;Participating high school students wrote an essay on the following topic: "You have been selected to give a speech at the Port-au Prince stadium in Haiti to all high school students. Your goal is to stress the importance of individual/collective creative initiatives and engagement for the reconstruction of Haiti.&nbsp; Include how to solve the current problems and then how to lay the foundations of sustainable development. Write your speech to mobilize the youth to be part of the nation building."</P><br /><br /><P>The goal of the Haitian Heritage Month Celebration is to promote multicultural awareness, understanding and acceptance of diversity in our society in order to better educate our student population and strengthen their self-esteem. This will contribute to improve their academic achievement and to recognize the valuable contributions made by Haitians to the history of America and the world.</P><br /><br /><P>Many other activities will take place county wide to celebrate Haitian Heritage Month which is a commemoration of Haitian pride everywhere in the United States where the Haitian population is significant.&nbsp; Haitian and Haitian American students represent the largest ethnic minority group from a single country in the School District of Palm Beach County with more than 14,000 students. According to community activists, Palm Beach County is home to more than 90,000 Haitians. </P><h3>Contact:</h3><p><P>Judith Klinek<BR><A href="mailto:klinek@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">klinek@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A></P><br /><br /><P>Nat Harrington</P><br /><br /><P>Vickie Middlebrooks</P></p><h3>Financial Impact:</h3><p>None</p></div>

Boynton High is proud of the BASA Academy students and teachers as they prepare for the future through this program.&nbsp; Our country will need these students as evidenced by the following statement:</P><br /><br /><P>Speaking at the World Aviation Training conference in Orlando, Florida on April 19&nbsp; Arnie Kraby, Delta's manager of pilot selection, said a dramatic pilot shortage is a "gathering storm" that industry must address. Delta alone in the next 15 years will lose 7,600 pilots who will reach age-65 and retire, says Kraby. </P><br /><br /><P>"First we need to educate, mentor and train students," says Kraby.&nbsp; One of the first goals would be to build an outreach program focused on middle- and high schools in an effort to stir up enthusiasm for the pilot profession.&nbsp; For every pilot there must be individuals to maintain the airplanes and management support along with the additional need for air-traffic controllers, engineers to design the new planes and aviation systems."</P><br /><br /><P>Boynton Aerospace Science Academy at Boynton Beach High is providing a great service to the students and the future of the aviation industry of our country.</P><br /><br /><P>Dr Robinson will present BASA students a poster of the Tuskegee airmen.</P><h3>Contact:</h3><p><P>Judith Klinek<BR><A href="mailto:klinek@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">klinek@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A></P><br /><br /><P>Nat Harrington</P><br /><br /><P>Vickie Middlebrooks</P></p><h3>Financial Impact:</h3><p>None</p></div>

<div class="itembody"><P><FONT face=Arial>These are two separate policies, although they must be purchased together. The first policy is the Student Catastrophic Insurance Policy which provides coverage of up to $5 million with a $25,000 per student deductible. This is&nbsp;required coverage for the District's participation in the Florida High School Activities Association for sanctioned sports and covers medical expenses resulting from accidental injuries to any student while participating in school activities (including daytime activities). The premium for this policy will remain the same as our currrent policy, which is $241,300. </FONT></P><br /><br /><P><FONT face=Arial>The second policy is the High School Interscholastic Athletic plan which covers up to $25,000 in medical expenses for accidental injuries to high school interscholastic athletes and cheerleaders. As of this year, the Florida High School Activities Association also requires some type of student accident&nbsp; insurance in order to participate in High School Interscholastic Athletics. This policy satisfies that requirement. Due to instituting various benefit reductions last year, the premium is being reduced 4.1% this year, from $1,325,850 to $1,271,000. </FONT></P><br /><br /><P><FONT face=Arial>Our broker, The Beacon Group, explored pricing from two other carriers and the cost was higher than the renewal from the current carrier, Monumental Life. The broker also contacted additional carriers who would not submit competitive bids because they could not come close to Monumental's benefits for the current premiums. </FONT></P><br /><br /><P><FONT face=Arial>Student insurance fees, as allowed by School Board Policy 5.60, cover approximately half of the premium. The current fee is set at $75.00 per student.</FONT></P><h3>Recommendation:</h3><p><FONT face=Arial>I recomment the School Board renew the purchase of the High School Interscholastic Athletic Insurance and Student Catastrophic Accident Insurance, effective August 1, 2011 to August 1, 2012 from the Monumental Life Insurance Company (General Agent: Bollinger Insurance) for a combined total premium of $1,512,300.</FONT></p><h3>Contact:</h3><p><P><FONT face=Arial>Joseph M.

<div class="itembody">This is a Memorandum of Understanding between the School District of Palm Beach County and the Area Agency on Aging to allow the Foster Grandparent Program into the schools to benefit the students of Palm Beach County. <br /><br />This agreement has been in place since 2008, and has served our schools and students successfully with assisting and mentoring students in the classroom.  This renewal shall commence on May 19, 2011 through May 18, 2014 and may be terminated with thirty (30) days written notice by either party.  The Area Agency on Aging ("AAA") shall recruit, interview, select, fingerprint (through School District Police) and enroll volunteers in the program who meet the criteria in the Foster Grandparent Program (FGP) Federal Regulations for enrollment in the program.  Each Foster Grandparent shall work with the student(s) according to a written Assignment Plan.  The plan identifies the needs of the child(ren) served, the role and activities of the volunteer, the expected outcomes for each child, and the period of time each child should receive such services.  Our schools will provide the “Foster Grandparents” a welcoming atmosphere and match them with children in need of additional care and academic enrichment.<br /><br /><h3>Recommendation:</h3><p>I recommend approval of the Memorandum of Understanding of the Foster Grandparent Program from May 19, 2011 through May 18, 2014 and authorize the Superintendent to sign all related documents.</p><h3>Contact:</h3><p>Judith Klinek klinek@palmbeach.k12.fl.us<br /><br /><br /><br />Nat Harrington harrington@palmbeach.k12.fl.us<br /><br /></p><h3>Financial Impact:</h3><p>There is no financial impact to the District budget; this program is completely voluntary</p></div>
