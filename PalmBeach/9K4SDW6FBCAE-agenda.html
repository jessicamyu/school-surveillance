<div class="itembody">Felicia Yan, a Wellington Community High School student, has been selected as the 2010-2011 District Scholar for the Sunshine State Scholar Recognition Program. Robert Cohen, an Olympic Heights Community High School student, has been selected as the District Alternate.&nbsp; Each of the eighteen district high schools had the opportunity to select one junior, distinguished in both mathematics and science, to represent each school. The District Scholar and District Alternate were selected based on the academic and extracurricular history of the school scholars, as well as the results of mathematics and science assessments administered on November 16, 2010.&nbsp; The District Scholar, her parents, and a science or mathematics teacher of the student's choice, will be invited to a recognition ceremony in Orlando, Florida on February 17-18, 2011. Students will be recognized for academic achievements, and have the opportunity to meet with recruiters from Florida colleges and universities. The goals for this event are to recognize student achievement and to increase the number of students with outstanding mathematics and science credentials who choose to attend Florida colleges and universities.<h3>Contact:</h3><p><P>Ann Killets<BR><A href="mailto:akillets@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">akillets@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A></P><br /><br /><P>Nat Harrington</P><br /><br /><P>Vickie Middlebrooks</P></p><h3>Financial Impact:</h3><p>None</p></div>

<div class="itembody"><P>The 2010-2011 Palm Beach County Outstanding Student, Adult and Senior School Volunteers have been named. Dhruv Tank a senior at Suncoast High School is the Student Volunteer of the Year, Maryann Polizzi from Alexander W. Dreyfoos Jr. School of the Arts is the Adult Volunteer of the Year and Ivorine Martin from Benoist Farms Elementary School is the Senior Volunteer of the Year.&nbsp; Over 37,000 volunteers work with our students and teachers supporting our goal of academic excellence.&nbsp; These three outstanding volunteers directly impact student achievement and are shining examples of the thousands of dedicated volunteers working with our students each and every day.</P><br /><br /><P>Dhruv Tank is an excellent student as well as being an extremely dedicated volunteer. He co-founded and manages a Mentor Club for freshman at Suncoast Community High School.&nbsp; This program began in 2008 and has grown to such importance that it is incorporated into the School Improvement Plan.&nbsp; The club's goal is to give each freshman a mentor who can assist in providing the new student a smooth transition from middle school to high school. Additionally, Dhruv is president of the Digital Divide Club, an organization that teaches students how to not only repair computers, but also how they work.&nbsp; He also works tirelessly providing computer and technological assistance to both students and teachers throughout the year.&nbsp; Dhruv Tank is a dedicated student who is devoted to the Suncoast High family.</P><br /><br /><P>For nine years every day, Monday thru Friday (and some weekends), Maryann Polizzi has been volunteering in Palm Beach County. The staff at Alexander W. Dreyfoos Jr. School of the Arts has been astonished watching her work her magic in developing school programs in ways they never thought possible.&nbsp; Ms. Polizzi has attended every School Advisory Council (SAC) meeting since August 2007 and currently serves as the Chair.&nbsp; She initiated a program where a group of volunteers help teachers with Scholastics and the National Foundation for Advancement in the Arts.&nbsp; She also volunteers for and sits on the board of the School of the Arts Foundation. In addition, Ms. Polizzi has served as the co-chair and chair of the Visual Arts Parents Association since 2007.&nbsp; This energetic volunteer also sells pizza during lunch period daily.&nbsp; For the past three years in the spring Ms. Polizzi has organized and prepared a staff recognition luncheon.&nbsp; </P><br /><br /><P>Ivorine L. Martin loves to volunteer, not just for the satisfaction of doing a good deed, but to see a child learn and grow.&nbsp; The students in Ms. York's kindergarten class at Benoist Farms Elementary School look forward to seeing Ms. Martin, to whom they refer as "Grandma," walk through the door each morning.&nbsp; At the beginning of the school year, she works with groups of students, until individual needs are assessed.&nbsp; After the needs are identified, she works with each child, one on one, every day.&nbsp; Her greatest joy is seeing a child learn to master a difficult task, such as writing his name for the first time.&nbsp; Ms. Martin, a Foster Grandparent through the Area Agency on Aging, also provides extras for the students who go without.&nbsp; Whether it's school supplies, or a hug, Ivorine Martin is willing to help out in any way she can because of her kind heart and generous spirit.&nbsp; </P><h3>Contact:</h3><p><P>Ann Killets<BR><A href="mailto:akillets@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">akillets@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A></P><br /><br /><P>Nat Harrington</P><br /><br /><P>Vickie Middlebrooks</P></p><h3>Financial Impact:</h3><p>None</p></div>

<div class="itembody"><P>As a winner of the a National Exemplary Innovative Substance Abuse Program, the FACE IT<SUP>SM</SUP> program was asked to apply for a Service to Science Initiative Mini-Subcontract.&nbsp; Those eligible to apply include 51 programs that participated in a Regional Service to Science Academy in 2010. The initiative provides direct assistance to program developers, implementers, and evaluators to help assess their programs' effectiveness through more rigorous evaluations. FACE IT<SUP>SM</SUP> was created with federal grant funding by the Prevention Center in the Department of Safe Schools and has been implemented District-wide for the past eight&nbsp;years. It is a family-based, educational, life-skills, substance abuse prevention and early intervention program for youth ages 12&nbsp;to 18 who are in trouble for Alcohol, Tobacco, or Other Drug (ATOD) offenses. They are referred from schools as an alternative to ATOD -related school suspension; from Youth Court in response to alcohol or other drug arrests; and from Teen Drug Court for more severe alcohol or other drug problems. Youth attend weekly FACE IT<SUP>SM</SUP> classes with their parents/caregivers. Siblings ages 12 to 18 are also invited to attend. In addition to the national award, FACE IT<SUP>SM</SUP> received Florida's 2007 Most Innovative Best Practices Substance Abuse Prevention Program award.</P><br /><br /><P>The Service to Science Mini-Subcontract will significantly impact FACE IT<SUP>SM</SUP>'s evaluation capacity to ensure program effectiveness. The expected outcomes of the program are to:</P><br /><br /><P>1. Reduce teen ATOD use<BR>2. Increase the number of youth who perceive ATOD is harmful to their health<BR>3. Enhance academic achievement by decreasing the number of days students miss for out-of-school ATOD suspension<BR>4. Improve family communication and family management strategies</P><br /><br /><P>Using existing resources, the data that has been collected and analyzed on FACE IT<SUP>SM</SUP> thus far includes: resuspensions; parent participation; suspension days saved, and program completion. </P><br /><br /><P>The impact of the project will be the development and implementation of a comprehensive evaluation plan and process that will demonstrate the effectiveness of FACE IT<SUP>SM</SUP>&nbsp; and its long-term impact on youth and their families.&nbsp; Such evidence is expected to help sustain the program through grants and other opportunities.</P><h3>Recommendation:</h3><p>I recommend that the School Board approve the Service to Science Initiative: Building Evaluation Capacity for Evidence-Based Interventions for up to $30,000, effective January 20, 2011 through January 19, 2012, and authorize the Superintendent or designee to sign all documents and contracts related to the grant which are required for implementation of the grant activities.</p><h3>Contact:</h3><p>Ann Killets <A href="mailto:akillets@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">akillets@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A> <BR>Alison Adler</p><h3>Financial Impact:</h3><p>The financial impact to the Special Revenue-Other Funds budget is an increase of up to $30,000. All grant-related expenditures and contracts are authorized for payment up to the amount of revenue.&nbsp; There is no financial impact to the Operating Budget.</p></div>

<div class="itembody"><P>1. The modernization of Gove Elementary School was approved in the 2011-2015 Five Year Plan.<BR>2. Several options were considered before proceeding with the proposed acquisition of the 18.80 acre contiguous site.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Rebuild onsite. There is not enough space on campus to build a replacement school without relocating the students and we are unable to relocate students offsite to another site at a&nbsp;reasonable cost.&nbsp; Several portables would have to be brought in to use West Tech.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. Acquire the City's 7-acre Mace Park.&nbsp; The park has&nbsp;deed restrictions that do not allow the school&nbsp;to be built on the park property.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. Relocate the school to another location within Belle Glade.&nbsp;&nbsp;We considered other sites such as the old hospital&nbsp;and West Tech, however there were problems with those sites such as proximity to other schools and the prison.<BR>3. The acquisition of the 18.80 acres located on S.E. Avenue "G", is contiguous to Gove Elementary School, and&nbsp;allows the students to remain at the existing Gove Elementary School until the construction of the new school is completed on the 18.80 acre site.<BR>4. Two buildings and the pavilion will remain on the existing school campus and will be converted into Ancillary Facilities.<BR>5. The 18.80 acre agricultural parcel of land has a five year lease due to expire on December 31, 2012.<BR>6. The cancellation of the lease will be handled by the current owner. The owner's loss of income for canceling the lease 25 months prior to expiration is $16,000.00.<BR>7. The averaged appraised value is $517, 000.00.<BR>8. The Purchase Price of $533,000.00 includes the averaged appraised value and the loss of income. <BR>9. The Phase I and Phase II Environmental Audit has been completed.&nbsp; The Phase II showed the muck was contaminated but not the groundwater.&nbsp; <BR>10. Program Management's modernization project includes a Soil Management Plan that involves excavating the retention area and placing the soil in designated areas on-site where it will be capped with a non-permeable surface to eliminate potential exposure to humans and prevent the impacted muck soils from leaching contaminates into the ground water. </P><h3>Recommendation:</h3><p>I recommend the School Board approve the Real Estate Sale and Purchase contract for acquisition of a vacant parcel of land containing 18.80 acres, more or less, for the modernization of Gove Elementary School, located in Belle Glade, Florida; and authorize the Superintendent and Chairman to sign all necessary documents</p><h3>Contact:</h3><p>Joseph M. Moore (<A href="mailto:moorej@palmbeachschools.org">moorej@palmbeachschools.org</A>)<BR>Joseph Sanches (<A href="mailto:sanchesj@palmbeachschools.org">sanchesj@palmbeachschools.org</A>)</p><h3>Financial Impact:</h3><p>The financial impact to the Capital Projects Funds Budget for the property acquisition is $533,000.00.</p></div>

T.E.N. could make a copy of the presentation and send a DVD to the awarded bus drivers.&nbsp; A plaque honoring all the bus drivers could be placed at their facility.&nbsp; Finally, we could partner with a local family restaurant to send the bus drivers and their families to dinner.&nbsp;<h3>Contact:</h3><p><P>Marcia Andrews&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P><br /><br /><P>Carol Bass, x48137</P></p></div>
