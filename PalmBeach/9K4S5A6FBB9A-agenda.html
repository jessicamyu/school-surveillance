<div class="itembody"><P>Instead of retiring to Florida to golf and rest following a successful business career in Youngstown, Ohio, Bertram "Bud" Tamarkin completed his Master's Degree in gerontology and started a new career as a full-time advocate.&nbsp; Along with his business acumen and experience, Mr. Tamarkin brings his passion to improve the lives of families in our community.&nbsp; For 20 years he has served as Executive Volunteer with the Palm Beach County Health Department in addition to his leadership roles in other community organizations.&nbsp; He was a charter member of the Governor's Council for Community Health Partnerships, a non-profit established to foster public/private partnerships to address community health issues.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P><br /><br /><P>Through his many roles, Mr. Tamarkin has spearheaded major initiatives to mobilize government leaders and private funders to deliver resources and services to neglected areas.&nbsp; His effectiveness lies in his ability to use his talent and charisma to bring together community leaders to find innovative solutions to difficult and long-standing problems.&nbsp; The list of his accomplishments is very long, but most importantly, he exemplifies what can be achieved through collaboration and innovative, results-based approaches.</P><br /><br /><P>Highlights of involvement with hunger/food issues:<BR>o He was instrumental in forming the Hunger Coalition, a diverse group comprised of individuals, social service agencies and faith-based organizations, to address critical nutrition needs of local residents. Under his leadership the Hunger Coalition increased summer food program sites from 18 to 102 in its first year.&nbsp; </P><br /><br /><P>o After a year of meetings and careful planning, Mr. Tamarkin and other members of the Hunger Task Force forged an agreement with Gulfstream Goodwill to donate warehouse facility, equipment, staff and volunteers to operate a new SHARE distribution center for Palm Beach and Martin counties.&nbsp; Prior to the 1999 opening of the center, host sites had to travel to Broward County to pick up the SHARE foods which prevented many smaller organizations from participating.&nbsp; </P><br /><br /><P>o In 2003, The Hunger Coalition recognized that there were no recent, accurate data on hunger and food insecurity to support strategic planning for food systems.&nbsp; Mr. Tamarkin was instrumental in securing funding for a research project to collect qualitative and quantitative information about food security in the county.&nbsp; USDA's U.S. Household Food Security Survey (HFSS) was used to conduct door-to-door surveys in areas with a median income of $35,000 or less.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the data was collected community partners participated in framing a plan that included both proactive long-term and short-term reactive strategies to address the identified needs of the community. </P><br /><br /><P>o Mr. Tamarkin was a founding member of the Food Security Council that was created as a result of the initial strategic planning efforts and was responsible for many of the early accomplishments of the Council, including obtaining funding for two refrigerated trucks used to transport donated perishable food.&nbsp; </P><br /><br /><P>o As the Council evolved into the Community Food Alliance, he has continued to be an active member of the leadership committee, taking on the role of interim director for several months.&nbsp; He is a staunch advocate for food access, and has been key member of the Access Committee.&nbsp; </P><br /><br /><P>o For many years, he has promoted the county's gleaning program and each year recruits volunteers to join him in the fields.</P><br /><br /><P>o He enthusiastically shares his passion and his wisdom with others and is a favorite of dietetic interns and students.&nbsp; </P><h3>Contact:</h3><p><P>Ann Killets<BR><A href="mailto:akillets@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">akillets@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A><BR>Nat Harrington</P><br /><br /><P>Vickie Middlebrooks</P></p><h3>Financial Impact:</h3><p>None</p></div>

<div class="itembody"><P>Alyssa Estornell, a Speech Language Pathologist in the Central Area ESE office has been awarded the National Education Association (NEA) Human and Civil Rights/George I. Sanchez Memorial Award.&nbsp; A member of the Classroom Teachers Association since 2006, Ms. Estornell co-authored the Palm Beach Spanish Communication Screener, a speech language screening instrument developed to assist in reducing the over identification of Hispanic children for formal communication evaluations. She piloted the Spanish Immersion Speech-Language Prekindergarten Intervention Program, where students are provided therapy in their native language. Ms. Estornell has also presented workshops on cultural competence and sensitivity when working with Hispanic children. Among her many other achievements, Ms. Estornell co-authored the Palm Beach Spanish Communication Screener. It is the first Spanish screener of its kind that provides statistical pass/fail standardized scores for young children in order to determine if further evaluation is warranted.&nbsp; All monolingual speech-language pathologists within the Palm Beach County School District were trained by Ms. Estornell on how to administer the Palm Beach Spanish Communication Screener. </P><br /><br /><P>George I. Sanchez (1906-1972) was an educator, historian, and author in the United States, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela. He devoted 50 years of his life to the education of Mexican, Navajo, and Black children and is known as the father of the movement for quality education for Mexican Americans.&nbsp; NEA presents the George I. Sanchez Memorial Award to a nominee whose activities in Hispanic affairs have made a significant impact on education and the achievement of equal opportunity for Hispanics. </P><h3>Contact:</h3><p><P>Ann Killets<BR><A href="mailto:akillets@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">akillets@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A><BR>Nat Harrington</P><br /><br /><P>Vickie Middlebrooks</P></p><h3>Financial Impact:</h3><p>None</p></div>

<div class="itembody">In May the Seminole Ridge Construction Academy students and teacher, Rick Terkovich, will proudly dedicate and turn over to the School District, a brand new building that the students designed and built as a part of their construction academy education.&nbsp; For the past three years, the students have worked with architect David Porter, local subcontractors, materials suppliers, district staff, and the building department to design the building and then to build the building.&nbsp; The structure began as a small ticket booth, about the size of a parking lot sales kiosk, for selling tickets at the school's football games.&nbsp; With a refinement of the project's "program" that the students completed from researching the building's real needs, the project grew into a 26' x 34', arched facade, gateway entrance into the school's football stadium to be used for ticket sales and greatly needed athletic department storage.&nbsp; The success of this project would not have been possible without the gracious donations of all of the materials that make up the building and sitework contributed by the local community, construction supply companies, subcontractors, and the very supportive school's administration.<h3>Contact:</h3><p><P>Ann Killets<BR><A href="mailto:akillets@palmbeach.k12.fl.us">akillets@palmbeach.k12.fl.us</A><BR>Nat Harrington</P><br /><br /><P>Vickie Middlebrooks</P></p><h3>Financial Impact:</h3><p>None</p></div>
