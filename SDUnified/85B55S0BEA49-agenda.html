The Association chose for the furlough days to be days when teachers and students would normally interact in their classrooms.   This meant that many students were deprived of many half days of instructional time even though the teachers were on duty and available.   While the fractional days vary, the fact is that students will be losing valuable instructional time when teachers are available.  Any loss of instruction must be considered detrimental to student achievement according to research about time and its effects on instruction.</font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Association has maintained that &#8220;teachers are the experts in instruction,&#8221; and the district certifies that we have &#8220;highly qualified&#8221; teachers in our classrooms.  To send kids home while these expert and highly qualified teachers engage &#8220;essential professional development&#8221; seems particularly ironic.

<br />
<b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">BACKGROUND:</font></b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"> In 2007, members of the community and district staff raised the issue of the need to update our policies and procedures concerning our obligation to allow students opportunities to access confidential medical services as defined in California Law and to respect student privacy. Thereafter, district staff sought legal advice regarding the changes necessary, and conferred regarding the practicalities of proposed changes. The board previously received information related to possible changes to policies and procedures, on December 11, 2007, but no action was taken. After additional work by district staff, recommended modifications are being brought to the board for consideration.</font><br />
<br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The changes will bring clarity to district policy and procedure related to the privacy rights of students, and to facilitate the early release of students, as specified by law, to obtain confidential medical services they are legally entitled to obtain.</font><br />
<br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Upon approval of these changes, staff will work with school site and other staff to ensure that appropriate practices are put in place to protect the privacy rights and health of students.</font><br />

S that provided an overview of the current accomplishments and status of the Prop. S Program.  Staff  requested board direction on two funding issues, the use of CCDC redevelopment funds for a portion of the prepaid lease of two floors of the proposed downtown library and other Prop. S projects in and adjacent to the redevelopment area and the use of early program savings.  The board directed staff to return on March 30, 2010, with additional information on the specific project impact of the CCDC funding issue before making a decision on both issues.  This agenda item addresses the use of CCDC redevelopment funds only.  The use of savings will be addressed in a separate board item.</font><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Discussion&#8212;</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Since March 2009, the projected funding available from local bond sales and state facilities matching funds for Prop. S over the next five years has declined by $134 million. This decline is due to the drop in the assessed value of real estate within the district, which reduces the amount of the annual assessment to fund bond interest for Prop. S and the anticipated reduction in state facilities matching funds.  The anticipated funding from state matching funds has declined because fewer projects eligible for matching funds can be awarded due to the lack of local bond revenue, and because the state currently has a backlog of eligible projects that cannot be funded due to the state of California&#8217;s current fiscal distress. </font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The result of this decline in funding and reprogramming of Prop. S projects has resulted in the need to delay 94 projects by one to two years and is called Option A.  The list of specific project delays is detailed in </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Attachment</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> 1.</font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">District staff has developed an alternative (Option B) that would partially mitigate these delays through the use of CCDC redevelopment funds.

Three district schools are located within the CCDC redevelopment area, Garfield and San Diego high schools, and Washington Elementary School.  Four adjacent schools are listed in the CCDC redevelopment agreement, Memorial Middle School, Perkins and Sherman elementary schools.  District legal staff has determined that schools within three miles from the center of the redevelopment area may be considered in the immediate neighborhood and eligible for CCDC redevelopment funds. Fourteen additional schools fall within the three mile radius, Alba at North Park, Birney, Burbank, Emerson/Bandini, Florence, Golden Hill, Grant, Jefferson, Kimbrough, Logan, McKinley, Rodriguez, and Rowan elementary schools. </font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">If $20 million of CCDC redevelopment funds are not used for a portion of the downtown school library lease and for projects indentified under Prop.

	<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><b>RECOMMENDATION: </b>Approve Option B for the use of early program savings in Proposition S.</span></span></p>
<p>
	<br />
	<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Option B: Return all cost avoidance dollars from the near-term favorable bid climate, to the program to accommodate future cost overruns, &ldquo;pop up&rdquo; requirements, and anticipated inflation for projects later in the program.<br />
	<br />
	<b>FISCAL IMPACT</b>: Option A may cause the scope of future projects in the Prop. S program to be reduced.<br />
	<br />
	<b>PRIOR YEAR EXPENSE HISTORY</b>:<b> </b>None.<br />
	<br />
	<b>IMPACT TO DISTRICT STAFFING</b>: None.<br />
	<br />
	<b>BACKGROUND:</b> On March 16, 2010, district staff presented a board workshop on Prop. S that provided an overview of the current accomplishments and status of the Prop. S program. Staff requested board direction regarding the use of cost savings on the occasion that individual project costs come in under budgeted amounts.<br />
	<br />
	Since the passage of Prop. S in November 2008, the program has enjoyed an owner favorable bidding climate that has resulted in a number of projects receiving construction bids that are below both district estimates and budgets. All cost avoidance savings have been retained in the Prop. S account and have not been used to increase scope at the site where costs came in lower than anticipated.<br />
	<br />
	While this favorable bidding climate has provided cost avoidance for these early projects, the economic downturn has also reduced available revenues for the Prop. S program in the near term, and increased the estimated duration of the program from 10 years to 16 to 18 years.<br />
	<br />
	The effect of this increase in duration increases the probability (certainty) that the district will experience an inflationary period before the program completes, and that projects later in the program will have to reduce scope and be reprogrammed. In the long term, staff projects that the total indicated cost for the entire scope of Prop. S work will exceed total available revenues by approximately $79 million if the bond program lasts 16 years.<br />
	<br />
	In the short term (next five years), due to a reduction in net assessed property values that has reduced our bonding capacity and less certainty that state matching funds will be available for use as programmed, the district projects a net reduction in revenues of $134 million over the next five years.<br />
	<br />
	In summary, both in the short and long term, the district must carefully manage its revenues, expenditures, and savings. Pertaining to short term savings, there are two options for their use: </span></span></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Option A: Keep any construction savings at the campus where the cost avoidance occurred and increase scope at the site. Savings could either be placed in reserve until the entire bond project list has been completed and then spent at the site, or savings could be spent immediately at the site by increasing scope. In either case, cost savings would remain at the site. </span></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Option B: Return all cost avoidance dollars from the near-term favorable bid climate, to the program to accommodate future cost overruns, &ldquo;pop up&rdquo; requirements, and anticipated inflation for projects later in the program.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Discussion: Option A presents the greatest benefit to sites that are scheduled towards the beginning of the bond. This benefit would be overridden by the likelihood (certainty) that construction cost inflation will create challenges to the program in the out years, and unless savings are retained in the Prop. S account, significant scope will not be accomplished at sites scheduled towards the end of the bond. Please note that currently our projected total indicated cost projected for a 16 year program is $2.379 billion, and we are programmed for only $2.3 billion.<br />
	<br />
	Option B retains all cost avoidance dollars in the Prop. S account for use in future projects. These savings would be consumed on scheduled projects and would not be used to increase scope at any site. Returning these funds to the account allows staff to mitigate the effects of certain inflationary pressures.<br />
	<br />
	ICOC Recommendation: The Independent Citizen&rsquo;s Oversight Committee opined at the March 16, 2010, Prop. S Board of Education Workshop that they were in strong support of Option B.<br />
	<br />
	Staff Recommendation: Staff most strongly recommends selection of Option B. This option increases the likelihood that program scope promised to the district&rsquo;s voters would be accomplished. This option has been used successfully in all previous bond projects. District staff is requesting that the board selects Option B. </span></span></p>

<ol type="1">
	<li><font size="4">Clairemont High School agreement with Golden Hall at City of San Diego on June 18, 2010 at an estimated cost of $3,355.00. The basic facility rental fee at Golden Hall is identical for all schools. This year schools (Clairemont HS, Crawford HS and Kearny HS) will not rent the silver room resulting in a lower license fee than last year. The district realizes the benefit of economies of scale by scheduling events back to back (contiguous), and pays only for one set-up fee.</font></li>
	<li><font size="4">Crawford High School agreement with Golden Hall at City of San Diego on June 18, 2010 at an estimated cost of $1,500.00. Ancillary fees to be determined after the event. (Please see comments under Clairemont HS).</font></li>
	<li><font size="4">Garfield High School agreement with Harry West Gym at San Diego City College on June 21, 2010 at an estimated cost of $2,165.00. Includes $1,000.00 deposit that will be refunded after the event.</font></li>
	<li><font size="4">Kearny High School agreement with Golden Hall at City of San Diego on June 18, 2010 at an estimated cost of $1,500.00. Ancillary fees to be determined after the event. (Please see comments under Clairemont HS).</font></li>
	<li><font size="4">Morse High School agreement with Viejas Arena at San Diego State University on June 21, 2010 at an estimated cost of $16,453.63. In an effort to assist with ever tightening budgets, this year schools (Morse HS and Scripps Ranch HS) will not be charged by Viejas Arena for the parking use fee resulting in a lower fee than last year.</font></li>
	<li><font size="4">Muir School permit with Balboa Park Administrative Courtyard Lawn at City of San Diego on June 18, 2010 at an estimated cost of $109.00. There are additional costs of $230.00 (chairs) and $210 (sound system) for a total of $549.00.</font></li>
	<li><font size="4">San Diego High Educational Complex agreement with Balboa Park Starlight Bowl on June 21, 2010 at an estimated cost of $1,750.00.</font></li>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Total $1,500+</font><br />
<br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">How will this be paid? $2,000 provided by Central Office, Chief Secondary School Improvement Officer; Crawford Foundation. There is no charge for guests to attend and no limit on the number of tickets. Reserved seats are sold as a fundraiser through the Foundation. Students provide their own transportation.</font><br />
<br />
<u><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Garfield High School</font></u><br />
<br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Reason: Garfield High School does not have a facility on campus large enough to accommodate 150 students, parents, and guests.</font><br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Venue: San Diego City College Harry West Gym</font><br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Date and time: June 21, 2010 at 9 a.m.</font><br />

<br />
<u><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Kearny High Educational Complex</font></u><br />

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Students will be transported by their parents.</font><br />
<br />
<u><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Morse High School</font></u><br />
<br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Reason: Morse High School does not have the capacity to seat all students and guests.</font><br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Venue: Viejas Arena at SDSU</font><br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Date and time: June 21, 2010 at 1:30 p.m.</font><br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Cost:</font></p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">$16,453.63 (site&rsquo;s portion of total shared with Scripps Ranch High)</font></li>
</ul>

<p><br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">How will this be paid? $2,000 provided by Central Office, Chief Secondary School Improvement Officer; site funds. Each senior receives four tickets at no cost; seniors with ASB cards receive six tickets at no cost. Additional tickets are $6.00 each. This is not a fundraiser. Students will drive themselves or be transported by their parents.</font><br />
<br />
<u><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Muir School</font></u><br />
<br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Reason: Promotion for Grades 6 and 8 are held on campus; senior commencement is held off-site.</font><br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Venue: Balboa Park Administrative Courtyard Lawn</font><br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Date and time: June 18, 2010 at 6 p.m.</font><br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Cost: $109</font><br />
<br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">How will this be paid? Up to $2,000 provided by Central Office, Chief Secondary School Improvement Officer. There is no charge for guests to attend. Students will be transported by their parents.</font><br />
<br />
<u><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">San Diego High Educational Complex</font></u><br />
<br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Reason: The cost to use Balboa Stadium would have been significantly higher than in past years because of rental fees for the stage, sound system, and specially mounted chairs; maintenance costs for cleaning the synthetic turf; and labor associated with site security to safeguard the equipment from the time it is set up on Friday until it is dismantled on Monday evening. The synthetic turf would have been compromised by students, parents, and guests wearing high-heel shoes, foot traffic, chairs, and heavy equipment. The district will not support the cost to maintain the synthetic turf; the cost to the site is approximately $6,000 annually. The projected lifespan of the turf is four years without a maintenance agreement and ten years with one. To protect the turf and increase its lifespan, the San Diego High Educational Complex will conduct its commencement exercise off-site. </font><br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Venue: Balboa Park Starlight Bowl</font><br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Date and time: June 21, 2010 at 5:30 p.m.</font><br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Cost:</font></p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Facility and ancillary fees - $1,750</font></li>
</ul>

<p><br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">How will this be paid? Up to $2,000 provided by Central Office, Chief Secondary School Improvement Officer. There is no charge for guests to attend. Students can either walk from the San Diego High Educational Complex to the Starlight Bowl or be transported by their families.</font><br />
<br />
<u><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">San Diego MET</font></u><br />
<br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Reason: The San Diego MET is located on the campus of Mesa College; space is inadequate for commencement.</font><br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Venue: Shiley Theatre at USD</font><br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Date and time: June 21, 2010 at 10 a.m.)</font><br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Cost:</font></p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Facility and ancillary fees - $2,000 (site&rsquo;s portion of $4,000 total shared with Twain)</font></li>
</ul>

<p><br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">How will this be paid? $2,000 provided by Central Office, Chief Secondary School Improvement Officer. There is no charge for guests to attend. Students provide their own transportation.</font><br />
<br />
<u><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Scripps Ranch High School</font></u><br />
<br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Reason: No facility on campus can accommodate the approximately 500 graduating seniors, their parents, and guests. Historically, the Scripps Ranch HS commencement exercises are attended by well over 3,500 guests. Scripps Ranch HS was built with stadium bleachers on only one side with a seating capacity of 1,500&ndash;1,800.</font><br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Venue: Viejas Arena at SDSU</font><br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Date and time: June 21, 2010 at 6 p.m.</font><br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Cost:</font></p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Facility - $17,468 (site&rsquo;s portion of total shared with Morse High)</font></li>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Diploma covers - $1,085</font></li>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Flowers for stage - $206</font></li>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Valedictorian and Salutatorian plaques - $112</font></li>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Paper, film, plates, and ink for production of graduation program - $1,240</font></li>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Paper for tickets - $278</font></li>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">District buses for band and choir - $500</font></li>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Miscellaneous supplies (bobby pins, safety pins, bags) - $24</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Total for facility - $17,468</font><br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Total for commencement costs - $3,446</font><br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Grand total - $20,914</font><br />
<br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">How will this be paid? $2,000 provided by Central Office, Chief Secondary School Improvement Officer; remaining balance from previous year&rsquo;s ticket sales. Graduating seniors are each given four complimentary tickets. The cost of each additional ticket is $10.00. This is not a fundraiser. The purpose of ticket sales is to cover expenses only. Should there be a remaining balance, those funds would be used to offset the cost of the commencement exercise for the following year. With the exception of band and choir students, graduating seniors either drive themselves to Viejas Arena or are transported by their parents.</font><br />
<br />
<u><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Twain High School</font></u><br />
<br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Reason: Mark Twain High School&rsquo;s main campus is located on a former elementary site with no &ldquo;stadium&rdquo; facility, and the seating capacity of the cafetorium is only 175. The two small satellite campuses are at opposite ends of the district. Using the facility at University of San Diego (USD) provides a central location and a venue large enough to accommodate approximately 140&ndash;160 graduating students and their families. Many Twain graduates are the first in their family to graduate from high school, and to recognize this major milestone, adequate seating is needed.</font><br />
<br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Venue: Shiley Theatre at USD</font><br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Date and times: June 21, 2010 at 1 p.m. (Twain Mesa and Twain Morse) and 3 p.m. (Main Twain and Twain SOAR)</font><br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Cost:</font></p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Facility and ancillary fees - $2,000 (site&rsquo;s portion of $4,000 total shared with San Diego MET) </font></li>
</ul>

<p><br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">How will this be paid? $2,000 provided by Central Office, Chief Secondary School Improvement Officer. There is no charge for guests to attend. Students provide their own transportation.</font></p>

Article III of Agreement No. SV-90-288-17 requires the district to provide no less than 120 days written notice to terminate this agreement on June 30, 2010.  Failure to provide this notice would cause this agreement to automatically renew for a new term beginning July 1, 2010.  For this fiscal year, that deadline would have fallen on March 2, 2010.</font><p><font size="4">On March 9, 2010, the board ratified an amendment to the agreement whereby the San Diego County Office of Education graciously agreed to shorten the notice period in Agreement No. SV-90-299-17 for a period of 30 days, and thereby extend the deadline for the district to provide notice of termination to April 2, 2010.</font><p><font size="4">In order for the board to have maximum flexibility during the establishment of its final budget for the 2010-11 fiscal year, it is in the best interest of district to provide notice to terminate the existing agreement at this time.  This action would not preclude the board from entering into a new agreement for the Palomar Mountain Outdoor School Educational Program after it has established its budget for the 2010-11 fiscal year.  This action would also provide staff with time to negotiate a new agreement that best meets the needs of the Off-Campus Integrated Learning Experience (OCILE) Program at Camp Palomar in accordance with the available funds in the approved 2010-11 budget to support it.</font><p><font size="4">[Originator/Originator: Phil Stover, Interim Special Projects Officer, 619.260.5432 pstover@sandi.net ]</font></div>

One approved action is to revise the Assistant Director, Food Services position to include responsibility for management and leadership of Distribution Services, and increase the position on the salary scale from a grade 28 to grade 32 to provide reasonable compensation for the additional duties.

The position of Director of Finance for Support Services has been recently filled with the appointment of a single incumbent who began District service on March 1, 2010.

It was determined that the salary grade for the Director of Finance for Support Services job class needs to be increased approximately 2.5 percent on the management salary schedule to salary grade 035.  This will better maintain a more equitable salary relationship with the comparative job classes based on the scope of duties and responsibilities of the position.  Upon approval, Human Resources can proceed and adjust the salary grade for the incumbent&#8217;s assignment back to the start date of March 1, 2010.

Currently, there are two in place; Deputy General Counsel and Assistant General Counsel.  There is currently a vacant 1.0 FTE Assistant General Counsel position.  Establishing an entry level job class at a lower salary grade is more cost effective than the current structure and would more efficiently utilize staff versus contracting out work. The recommendation is to establish an entry-level job class that will not exceed the amount of $110,243 in annual salary.  The cost savings is a difference of $5,233 annually as a result of the new position being compensated approximately 5 percent lower than the vacancy. The vacant position pays a maximum salary of $115,476.  There&#8217;s an additional $1,582 in cost savings through June 2009 based on the former incumbent&#8217;s star-rated salary.   </font><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">IMPACT TO DISTRICT STAFFING:  </font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">A (1.00 FTE) position of Assistant General Counsel at salary grade 032 has recently been vacated.

Consistent with the department&#8217;s March 2009 reorganization goals to save money and to more efficiently use in-house attorneys versus contracting out work, the Board of Education gave direction and authorization to hire a current Legal Services intern in a newly established entry-level attorney job class.  This will provide career ladder opportunities in the attorney job classes to include Assistant General Counsel, based on years of experience in school law, then up to a single position of Deputy General Counsel.  Approval of the new job </font><font size="4">classification and position description of Associate General Counsel, at management salary grade 030, is commensurate with the scope and responsibilities in comparison to the two higher level job classes and maintains an equitable salary relationship within the attorney ranks.

To date, the District and the YMCA have successfully collaborated on two joint venture projects, the skateboard park that was built on the Whittier site and the roller-hockey rink that was built on the Clairemont High School site.  The district and YMCA have also entered into a joint use agreement for shared parking at Correia Middle School in exchange for use of the YMCA&#8217;s new gymnasium facilities.</font><br><font size="4"> </font><br><font size="4">The YMCA recently approached the district with another proposal to consider the feasibility of constructing a satellite YMCA on the Pacific Beach Middle School site.  Before either the YMCA or the Board of Education can determine if the project would be feasible, various studies need to be conducted.  The proposed satellite YMCA facilities would consist of an administration area, locker/shower room, fitness center, indoor arena, artificial turf joint use field, restroom/storage building and parking lot.  The YMCA is looking to possibly lease, for 40-50 years, and remodel the old library/special education resource center for a fair market rental rate. The Pacific Beach Center currently houses Race Human Relations and Advocacy and one Transition Resources for Adult Community Education class.  The YMCA facilities could provide enhanced educational and recreational opportunities for the students of Pacific Beach Middle School, the community, and YMCA members.  The district would provide use of the land in exchange for use of YMCA facilities.</font><br><font size="4"> </font><br><font size="4">[Originator/Contact:  Drew Rowlands, Executive Director, Auxiliary Services, </font><a href="mailto:wrowlands@sandi.net"><font size="4">Office of the Chief Financial Officer, 858.627.7121</font><b><font size="4" color="#0000FF">, </font></b><u><font size="4" color="#0000FF">wrowlands@sandi.net</font></u></a><font size="4">]</font></div>

This project is intended to be re-bid upon receiving direction from the board. </font><font size="4"><br></font><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>BACKGROUND:</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> This project was the first Prop. S project publicly bid that incorporated the board-approved Project Stabilization Agreement (PSA). </font><p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">On this project, five contractors submitted bids. The lowest responsive and responsible bid came in nearly 20 percent above government estimate. These results are inconsistent with the brief history of the Proposition S (Prop. S) program. Prior to this bid, bids for the eight previous school construction projects under Prop. S received between 7-14 bidders and bid estimates came in between 5-49 percent below the government estimate. </font><font size="4"><br></font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>Under section 2.3 the PSA, if a bid exceeds the government estimate by 10 percent or more, and the increase is due to application of the PSA, the district has the choice of rebidding the project with or without application of the PSA. </font><font size="4"><br></font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>To inform the district&#8217;s decision, two analyses must be completed: verifying that the bid exceeded the government estimate by 10 percent, and attributing the additional cost to application of the PSA. </font><font size="4"><br></font><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>Validity of the Government Estimate:</font></u></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>The government estimate for this project, as with all Prop. S construction projects, was developed by an independent, professional cost estimating firm, with additional validation from district staff. </font><font size="4"><br></font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>To further validate the government estimate for this project, staff, at the request of a special ad-hoc subcommittee of the Independent Citizens Oversight Committee (ICOC), prepared data supporting costs for the scope of work comprising the project and compared those costs to other Prop. S projects. After three meetings, the subcommittee, comprised of experienced construction professionals, concluded that the government estimate accurately reflected the value of the work required to complete the project, and forwarded its finding to the full ICOC. The ICOC agreed with the conclusion of the subcommittee. Accordingly, staff is confident in the accuracy of the government estimate and that the low bid exceeded the value of the scope of work required by the project.</font><font size="4"><br></font><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>Attribution of Increased Costs</font></u></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>Staff believes that application of the PSA accounted for the increased costs in this bid for following reasons:</font><ol type="1"><li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Over the brief history of the Prop. S program, school construction projects have consistently attracted between 7-14 bidders. On this project, five contractors submitted bids, despite 15 contractors attending the mandatory pre-job site walk.</font><li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Anecdotal evidence suggests that prospective bidders avoided bidding on this project specifically because it was covered by the PSA, including the contractor currently working on the site. The PSA's new set of unknown conditions likely caused some bidders to include a greater contingency, and likely caused other prospective bidders to decline to bid.</font><li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Staff analyzed and rejected, as not supported by the evidence, other factors that could have explained to increased costs, including:</font><font size="4"> </font><ul type="disc"><li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">ambiguities within the bid document-the relative uniformity in bid prices suggest that bidders all saw the project the same way, and that the documents were clearly understood</font><font size="4"> </font><li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">changes in the bidding climate-the fact that bids subsequent to this project came in under project estimate suggest that the increased cost was not the result of a fundamental change in the bidding climate for construction projects in San Diego</font><font size="4"> </font><li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">increases in construction, materials or labor costs-trend data from industry sources show no radical increases in construction, materials or labor costs which would explain the bids</font><font size="4"> </font><li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">complexity of the project-although the project incorporates &#8220;Green&#8221; design, materials, and technologies, neither the project nor the site pose any extraordinary construction challenges</font></ul></ol><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Conclusion and Recommendation</font></u></b><font size="4"><br></font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Staff is hereby recommending that the Board of Education take the following actions</font><ol type="1"><li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Reject all bids for the Hoover Woodshop project </font><li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Re-bid the Hoover Woodshop project without application of the PSA. </font></ol><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In support of the above, staff considered the following factors in developing its recommendation: </font><ul type="disc"><li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">It is the district's responsibility to deliver safe, well constructed facilities at the best value to the district. It is more probable that this goal would be achieved by rebidding outside without the PSA requirement.</font><font size="4"> </font><li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Staff has examined this project and found no substantial reason for cost escalation other than the PSA.</font><font size="4"> </font><li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">It is the staff&#8217;s opinion that the increased cost is due to application of a risk premium by the bid submitters due to unknown costs associated with the PSA.</font><font size="4"> </font><li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">When examined, there is no factual reason to believe that if re-bid under the PSA agreement, that the bid results will be substantially different.</font><font size="4"> </font><li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">It is staff's opinion that the bid results from the Madison Multimedia and Clairemont Automotive projects are independent of, and would have no bearing on, future bid results for the Hoover Green construction project.</font><font size="4"> </font></ul><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Per Public Contract Code section 20111 (b) a school district is required to competitively bid a public works project valued at $15,000 or more.
