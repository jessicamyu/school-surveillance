<div class="itembody"><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">RECOMMENDATIONS</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">: The Board of Education will be considering the scope of work and funding options for phase three of the Career Technical Education Program work, Gompers Charter School Prop. S scope expansion, Millennial Technical Middle School scope expansion, Crawford High School whole-site modernization options, Mann Middle School whole-site modernization options, Henry High School Prop. S scope expansion, the continued build out of the proposed Salk Elementary School, and future proposed work at Central-Wilson. </font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Staff recommends participation in phase three of the state&#8217;s Career Technical Education matching grant program with funds apportioned from the State Schools Facilities Funds or by re-apportioning Prop. S site budgets across the program ($15.2 million maximum contribution). </font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Staff recommends apportioning $13 million of State Schools Facilities Funds for the construction of a 15,000-square foot education building, a multipurpose building and a parent drop-off and parking area at Millennial Tech. </font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Staff recommends that the Board of Education examines the range of possible options for whole-site modernization projects at Crawford High School and Mann Middle School, and then assess the best sources of additional revenues needed to finance additional scope. </font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Staff recommends construction of a new performing arts center at Henry High School. This increase of scope is estimated to be approximately $8 million.  Staff estimates that approximately $4 million will be needed to augment the Prop. S budget from State Schools Facilities Funds.  </font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Staff recommends continuing with the construction Salk Elementary in Mira Mesa.  The project budget is $31 million of programmed State Schools Facilities Funds. </font><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">FISCAL IMPACT</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">: In regard to the Career Technical Education Program, Board of Education actions will direct staff either to proceed with applying for the State of California Career Technical Education Program matching funds or not to proceed with applying for these funds. District matching funds may come from re-alignment of State Schools Facilities Funds. </font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Pertaining to Gompers Charter School&#8217;s Prop. S scope expansion, Millennial Technical Middle School scope expansion, Crawford High School&#8217;s whole-site modernization options, Mann Middle School whole-site modernization options, Henry High School&#8217;s Prop. S scope expansion; possible Board of Education actions will fix the amount of Prop. S funds and State Schools Facilities Funds allocated for the projects defined above.</font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">These decisions are not expected to change the overall Prop. S program budget. These decisions will impact the amount of non-Prop. S funds, largely State Schools Facilities Funds, spent at Gompers Charter School, Millennial Technical Middle School, Crawford High School, Mann Middle School and Henry High School (proportional to proposed changes in scope at each project). The Board actions will provide guidance to the staff to either expand the scope of work at these sites with funds apportioned from the State Schools Facilities Account or to not increase the scope of work.  Board actions will impact the availability of State School Facilities Funds to be used for other uses within the district.</font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Regarding the future Salk Elementary School project, Board of Education actions will either direct staff to continue planning to build this school (funded out of State Schools Facilities Funds) or stop planning to build this school.</font><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">BACKGROUND</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">:  </font><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Career Technical Education-</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The district has recently learned that a third round of Career Technical Education (CTE) matching funds will be made available to eligible districts.  SDUSD may be eligible for approximately $15.5 million in matching funds.  The district&#8217;s CTE Department has identified the following 12 potential projects:</font><br><ul type="disc"><li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Kearny High School Construction Tech Academy</font><li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Mira Mesa High School Culinary Arts </font><li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Mira Mesa High School Screen Printing and Computerized Graphic Design</font><li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Mira Mesa High School Arts Management </font><li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Hoover High School Academy of Information Technology</font><li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">San Diego High School Health Science/Biomedical/Biotech</font><li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Henry High School Arts, Media, and Entertainment</font><li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">School of Creative and Performing Arts Media and Entertainment</font><li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Crawford (High School) IDEA Sustainable Energies</font><li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Clairemont High School Simulated Trading Floor Academy of Business and<br>technology</font><li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">University City School Fabrication and Design</font></ul><br><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Staff needs direction regarding the funding source for the CTE matching funds.  </font></u><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Millennial Tech Middle School-</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Millennial Tech Middle (MTM) School is located on the Gompers East campus, which was built in 1962.  Originally, it was the Wright Brothers Career Center.  MTM has a student population of 455, with an expected population of 600 by 2011.  The site can be considered to be in fair condition.  It is not considered overcrowded. However, there isn&#8217;t sufficient capacity to accommodate expected increases in enrollment.  A total of eight portable classrooms will be needed to accommodate expected enrollment increases. </font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The district proposes to construct a parent drop-off and parking area to accommodate program growth and promote vehicular safety.  Additionally, the district proposes to build a new academic building on the site and a multipurpose building to bring this site up to district standards for middle schools.  The Prop.. S budget for Millennial Tech is $16.7 million.  </font><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">An additional $13.5 million is requested to complete construction of the additional work (academic building, and multipurpose building.  </font></u><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Gompers Charter-</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Gompers was built in 1955.  It has a student population of 600 students, with expansion plans to include a new high school program.  (Population estimates are not available for this program.)  The campus can be considered to be in fair condition; however, 49 percent of the 53 classrooms are considered to be undersized, and seventeen of 17 permanent buildings are over 50 years old.  There are significant ADA problems on the campus.  The site is not air-conditioned.  The site is not overcrowded.  The Prop. S budget for this site $17.9 million.</font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Gompers Charter has requested that the 6.2 acre decomposed granite play field adjacent to its site be reserved for athletic fields in support of future Gompers Middle School and Gompers High School athletic programs.  The site has presented  plans for a baseball and softball fields and a soccer field.  These attributes are unfunded.   </font><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The cost of these improvements is between $4 and $6 million.</font></u><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Current district plans include placement of  portable classrooms for a period of     32-36 months on the northern perimeter of the site.  Gompers has requested that the district not place portable classrooms on this parcel.  These portables will occupy approximately 25,000 square feet of the 6.2 acres. Ongoing discussions are underway between the district, Gompers and Millennial Tech representatives. </font><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Mann Middle School-</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Mann Middle School was built in 1952.  It has a student population of 1,100.  The population is expected to decrease slightly in the near term.  The campus is considered to be, at best, in fair condition.  There are significant soils and geotechnical problems on the site.  The concrete flatwork is in poor condition.  There are significant ADA problems.  The site is considered by staff to be at the end of its service life and wholesale demolition and reconstruction should be considered as an alternative to modernization.  Eighty-one percent of the buildings are over 50 years old.  The site is not overcrowded.  There are new roofs on the buildings, and the campus has a new library.  The kitchen needs to be renovated.  Building 200 has significant floor movement due to soils and foundation problems.  The Prop.. S budget for Mann is $67.9 million.</font><br><br><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Staff requires direction as to how to proceed with the planned Mann Middle </font></u><br><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">School Prop. S project.</font></u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">  The current plan is to renovate/rebuild the site in its existing</font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">location.  Another option is to rebuild the site in conjunction with planned work at Crawford High School, and use the current Mann site for an extensive athletic complex.</font><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Crawford High School-</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Crawford High School was built in 1957.  It has a student population of 1,514.  The population is expected to be stable for the near future.  The campus is considered to be in fair-to-good condition.  The site has 21 portable buildings on site.  Twelve of the 15 buildings on site are over 50 years old.  There is significant ADA problems on the campus.  The site requires upgrades to dining areas, food service areas, ventilation, and restrooms.  The football field needs a complete renovation.  Storm water management is a problem.  The campus is not considered to be overcrowded.  The estimated Prop.. S budget for Crawford High School is $51.8 million.</font><br><br><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Staff requires direction as to how to proceed with the planned Crawford High School Prop. S project</font></u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">.  The current plan is to conduct significant renovation work to the site. An alternative is to rebuild the entire site in conjunction with rebuilding Mann Middle School.  </font><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Additional non-Prop. S funds in the amount of $60-$80 million will be required to execute this proposal</font></u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">. </font><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Henry High School-</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Henry High School does not have a dedicated performing arts center; therefore, it utilizes a &#8220;cafetorium&#8221; for high school assemblies and performances.  This design feature is inadequate for a school site with a population 2,400 students.  The district recommends construction of a 500-seat performing arts center.  The rough estimate for this feature is approximately $8.8 million.  Partial funding (about 50 percent) for this increase in scope will come out of the modernization budget for the site </font><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">and the remaining funds will need to come from other sources</font></u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">.  There is a possibility that a CTE grant could be applied to the project.  Other capital facilities funds may need to be apportioned to this project. </font><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Salk Elementary School-</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The district demographer has determined that the Mira Mesa area will require additional elementary school capacity by 2015.  This demand is being driven by normal population growth and planned construction of several large housing projects in the area that will add more than 5,000 housing units to the area.  The budget for this Prop. MM project is $31 million.  The funds for this project have been set aside in the state schools facilities account.  To meet this demand, construction is planned to commence in 2013 and be completed by September 2015.  </font><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Staff requests permission to proceed with this timeline</font></u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">.  </font><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Wilson Middle School-</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Wilson Middle School was built in 1944.  The entire campus is in poor condition, and is planned for a complete replacement.  There are 782 students on the campus.  The Prop. S budget for Wilson is $64.9 million.</font><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Central Elementary-</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Central Elementary School was built in 1938.  The site is in poor condition, and needs to be relocated due to a high pressure gas line that runs through the middle of the site.   </font><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">A decision needs to be reached pertaining to the ultimate disposition of this campus.</font></u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">   </font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">A potential solution is to create a K-8 or other campus model at the Mann Middle School site.  The total Prop. S budget for Central is $31.1 million.  </font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Current plans are to demolish this campus and rebuild both Wilson and Central on the Wilson site.  It is anticipated that the Central site would then be sold as excess property. </font><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Staff requires direction pertaining to how to proceed with the planned Central-Wilson project.</font></u><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">[Originator/Contact: Stuart Markey, Executive Director Capital Improvement Bond Program 858.637.3516, </font><a href="mailto:smarkey@sandi.net"></a><a href="mailto:smarkey@sandi.net"><u><font size="4" color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman">smarkey@sandi.net</font></u></a><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">] </font></b><br><br><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B8KD0D2575/$FILE/Prop%20S%20Update%20Memo%20071609.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B8KD0D2575/Body/0.37B8?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="167" height="47" alt="Prop S Update Memo 071609.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B8KD0D2575/$FILE/Prop%20S%20Update_7-28-09%20Board%20mtg._rev%207-27-09_v2.ppt"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B8KD0D2575/Body/0.455C?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="270" height="47" alt="Prop S Update_7-28-09 Board mtg._rev 7-27-09_v2.ppt" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B8KD0D2575/$FILE/Prop%20S%20Update_7-28-09%20Board%20mtg._rev%207-27-09_v2.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B8KD0D2575/Body/0.55A6?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="270" height="47" alt="Prop S Update_7-28-09 Board mtg._rev 7-27-09_v2.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B8KD0D2575/$FILE/SSF%20Prg%20Fund.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B8KD0D2575/Body/0.64FE?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="92" height="47" alt="SSF Prg Fund.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B8KD0D2575/$FILE/SSFF%20Expenditure%20Prjctn.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B8KD0D2575/Body/0.719A?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="141" height="47" alt="SSFF Expenditure Prjctn.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B8KD0D2575/$FILE/Developer%20Fees%200910%20Budget.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B8KD0D2575/Body/0.7F6A?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="165" height="47" alt="Developer Fees 0910 Budget.pdf" border="0"></a></div>
