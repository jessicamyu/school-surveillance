Funds are to support the development of the magnet program including staff professional development, supplies, equipment and specific personnel to implement the magnet theme, promote diversity, increase choices in public education programs, and turnaround student achievement as outlined in the district proposal. It is anticipated that the federal government will be awarding approximately 40 to 45 grant awards in August of 2010. There are generally between 250&#8211;300 districts applying.

These estimates are based on current bell times and maximum coverage of the district following current Magnet Express Routing policies and procedures. As part of the district&#8217;s current rigorous evaluation of its magnet schools, analysis of access to programs will be studied and replicated as recommended. District transportation costs will be kept to a minimum. Some costs will be associated with targeted recruitment to ensure equity and access to the programs over the three years of the award. (Attachment 1- Transportation)</font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Sustaining the magnet six programs after the MSAP grant is concluded at the new and significantly revised magnet schools will follow district magnet schools budget schedules.

In the current 2007 grant cycle, the district will receive by October 2010, $10,837,237 in restricted allocations. As part of the MSAP six purposes, the MSAP-funded schools are to improve their capacity and sustain their magnet school programs through professional development, theme inclusive curriculum mapping, and student achievement strategies after the Federal funding has ended. Staff included in the grant have been kept to a minimum so that they can be absorbed into the district magnet schools&#8217; budget allocation.</font><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">IMPACT TO DISTRICT STAFFING:</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> The Magnet Schools Assistance Program provides job opportunities for district certificated and classified staff as student enrollment increases at the MSAP-funded schools. Each MSAP-funded school will require one salaried district position as magnet coordinator. The magnet coordinator at these sites will be funded by the grant and sustained by the district after the grant following magnet schools budget allocation schedule. Specialized programs may require new staff members at the school site with specific credentials or job skill requirements. The MSAP office requires up to two salaried district central office resource teacher positions to assist schools in grant implementation and one staff member for marketing and recruitment. These positions will be funded by the grant, and therefore have an end date following the grant timeline. </font><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">BACKGROUND: </font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The grant application is due on Monday, May 3, 2010, by 12 noon EST in the Office of Innovation and Improvement, Magnet Schools Assistance Program (MSAP), U.S. Department of Education. The district Magnet Schools office is preparing the grant proposal for the 2010 U.S. Department of Education, Office of Innovation and Improvement, Magnet Schools Assistance Program. The MSAP grant a competitive federal grant award that provides support to districts to significantly revise existing or develop new magnet schools, supporting district integration efforts and closing the achievement gap. </font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The MSAP grant award provides the initial funds necessary to develop inventive, exciting educational programs that attract students from all racial and socio-economic backgrounds to attend. There are six specific goals associated with this federal grant: Integration, Student Academic Success, Magnet Theme/Innovation, 21st Century Skills for Attainment of Tangible and Marketable Skills, Sustainability, and Academic Equitable Access.</font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The district&#8217;s network of magnet schools has been the cornerstone of the district&#8217;s court-ordered voluntary integration program (Attachment 2 - San Diego Plan for Racial Integration). In keeping with the court order, the school district periodically assesses the Magnet Schools program and, when indicated, refocuses or modifies magnet programs and/or adds new magnet programs to improve effectiveness in attaining and maintaining racial-ethnic balance and student achievement outcomes. All district application and enrollment procedures remain race-neutral. &#8220;Racial-ethnic balance&#8221; describes an aspirational goal that is pursued solely by race-neutral means.</font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Schools recommended by the Board of Education for the new grant cycle were discussed and approved March 16, 2010. One school, Lindbergh Schweitzer, has been added to meet a specific, priority criteria in the grant. The six district schools participating in this competitive grant application titled &#8220;Success through Student Engagement&#8221; are new magnet schools: John Adams Leadership Academy (K-5 dedicated magnet), Mann Innovations in Communication (IinC) and  FLAGS Academy (6-8 total school magnet with dedicated FLAGS Academy), Washington 21st Century International School (K-5); and significantly revised magnet schools: Lindbergh Schweitzer Service through Action and Communication Magnet School (K-6), Roosevelt Middle School STEAM International Baccalaureate Middle Years Programme (6-8), Mission Bay High School International Baccalaureate Middle Years and Diploma Programme (9-12).  School staff and community members have participated in theme and pedagogy planning.

San Diego International Studies School and Roosevelt Middle, as well as, Mission Bay High School are magnet schools providing equitable access to the IB Programme through magnet transportation. At this time, Pacific Beach Middle School&#8217;s IB Programme is limited by VEEP constraints, limiting access to the Mission Bay High cluster IB continuum. The current VEEP articulation pattern includes Johnson, Kimbrough, Rodriguez, Sherman, and Webster elementary schools. By granting Pacific Beach Middle School magnet status families across the district will have equal access to either the San Diego High or Mission Bay High IB cluster continuum. This will provide neighboring resident schools to the VEEP schools access to the IB Programme as well. In addition, by providing students districtwide access to Pacific Beach Middle School through magnet transportation, there will be an increase in the number of students better prepared to articulate directly into the IB Diploma Programme at Mission Bay High School. <br><br>The magnet articulation pattern, supported by transportation, will begin in 2010-11 following transportation procedures as approved by the Board of Education. Pacific Beach Middle School will continue transportation for students attending the school through VEEP as magnet students. They do not need to reapply to the school.<br></font><b><font size="4"><br>Discussion of Instructional International Baccalaureate K-12 Articulation - </font></b><font size="4">Pacific Beach Middle School was authorized as an International BaccalaureateWorld School by the Geneva based International Baccalaureate Organization in 2007. The reason for the district- initiated move towards establishing IB programs at both Mission Bay High and Pacific Beach Middle was to address concerns expressed by Pacific Beach families. The parent&#8217;s primary concern was the &#8220;lack of a quality educational program&#8221; at the secondary level in Pacific Beach. Many families in Pacific Beach and Mission Beach choose to send their children to schools in La Jolla rather than have them attend their neighborhood schools. With a feasibility study beginning in 2002-03 and authorization in 2007, Pacific Beach Middle School and Mission Bay High school began to implement the prestigious International Baccalaureate Programs.<br><br>The International Baccalaureate Middle Years Program is based on the philosophy and framework of the International Baccalaureate Organization with a focus on providing quality programs of international education to a worldwide community of schools. There are more than 794,000 IB students at 2,870 schools in 138 countries. The IB Middle Years Program, for students aged 11 to 16, provides a framework of academic challenge that encourages students to embrace and understand the connections between traditional subjects and the real world, and become critical and reflective thinkers. The program consists of eight subject groups integrated through </font><i><font size="4">five areas of interaction</font></i><font size="4"> that provide a framework for learning within and across the subjects. Students are required to study their mother tongue, a second language, humanities, sciences, mathematics, arts, physical education and technology. In the final year of the program, students also engage in a personal or culminating project, which allows them to demonstrate the understandings and skills they have developed throughout the program.<br><br>The IB MYP allows the schools to design their own curriculum based on the framework fundamentals of the program and the California State Standards. Students are encouraged to develop and maintain proficiency in English and at least one other language. Spanish is offered as the Language B World Language offering.<br><br>The Mission Bay High School cluster IB continuum begins at the kindergarten level at Sessions Elementary and continues through Pacific Beach Middle School and on to Misison Bay High School&#8217;s Diploma Program. Certificated staff have been hired and trained to design and deliver the program to all students at Pacific Beach Middle School as this program is designed as a whole-school framework and philosophy. <br><br>As stated previously, reasons for increasing access to Pacific Beach Middle School through Magnet Schools program is twofold. First, is to strengthen academic success in the Mission Bay High cluster IB continuum. Second, is to provide students equitable access to the programme through a broader transportation network. It is the intention of the cluster to prepare students to achieve in the challenging IB Diploma high school coursework and ultimately increase the number of students earning the full IB Diploma at Mission Bay High School. There is also the potential to increase the number of students enrolled in AP and/or IB courses during the student&#8217;s high school career. As a result of the rigor of the IB, more students in the Pacific Beach area are choosing to stay and attend the local middle school. In addition, under the leadership of the principals, the Spanish and mathematics departments from Pacific Beach Middle and Mission Bay High School have begun meeting and collaborating with a focus on preparing all students for the rigors of high school. Both schools are working together to address the needs of the significant numbers of English Learners in our schools. By providing Pacific Beach Middle School magnet status students from across the district and out of district will have access to the IB programs. <br><br>Resident parents not wishing their student to participate in the IB MYP program will continue to have alternative options through the Choice Program. It is the school&#8217;s focus to continue recruiting both resident students as well as increased marketing to private, new-to-the-district and out-of-district students who may otherwise be choosing to attend schools outside SDUSD. Magnet marketing and recruitment strategies were put into place during the 2009-10 school year. A marked increase in the number of families attending monthly parent tours and expressing interest in attending the Pacific Beach Middle Years Programme has been noted. Families interested in a balanced program of international education that leads to increased achievement and student success in the IB Diploma Program will lead to the continued increase in enrollment of resident students and the increase in enrollment of families who have expressed interest in from areas such as Clairemont, Kearny Mesa, Morse, Serra, and University City.<br><br>The Mission Bay High School and Sessions Elementary School have embraced the IB philosophy. During the last four years, the schools have revised curriculum to meet both the local and regional requirements as well as the IB objectives and program standards for each of the respective programs. While it would benefit the cluster to be able to offer more primary or elementary IB programs, due to budget cutbacks the cluster understands that this is not a possibility at this time. Access to the IB continuum continues to be a popular choice for many families.<br><br>IB MYP and Diploma Program are supported through school site budgets at the secondary level. Pacific Beach Middle and Mission Bay High School have received school allocations to offer the program. Pacific Beach Middle School is requesting continued district support for the 2010-11 school year and inclusion into the Magnet Program to increase access to families through transportation as outlined by district procedures. Both schools are committed in future years to support the IB through their school site budgets and additional funding as provided by the district. <br></font><b><font size="4"><br>Transportation - </font></b><font size="4">In meeting the goal to build accessible International Baccalaureate programs through an economically sound transportation plan the following rules will be followed: current VEEP transportation routes will be utilized for magnet students articulation to Pacific Beach and Magnet routes to Mission Bay; the rule of 15 student ridership outside the Mission Bay Cluster will be maintained. <br><br>VEEP patterns are established for Johnson, Kimbrough, Rodriguez, Sherman, and Webster students to attend Pacific Beach Elementary, Kate Sessions Elementary, and Pacific Beach Middle. Additionally, Washington Elementary students have a current VEEP pattern to Pacific Beach Middle. Transportation will continue to be provided to VEEP students attending Pacific Beach Elementary and Kate Sessions Elementary following transportation guidelines. Current VEEP transportation costs will transfer to Magnet transportation costs with buses at capacity. In anticipation of the IB programme&#8217;s popularity the following table outlines possible transportation costs over the next </font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">three years. This cost is estimated at a 10 percent increase each year over the 2009-10 cost of $36,000 per bus. </font><ul><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2009-2010</font></u></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>VEEP 5 Buses X $36,000 = $180,000</font><font size="4"> </font><p><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2010-2011</font></u></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>Magnet 6 Buses @ $39,600 = $237,600</font><font size="4"> </font><p><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2011-2012</font></u></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>Magnet 8 Buses @ $43,560 = $348,480</font><font size="4"> </font><p><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2012-2013</font></u></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>Magnet 9 Buses @ $47,916 = $431,244</font></ul><br><b><font size="4"><br>Facilities Implications - </font></b><font size="4">Pacific Beach Middle has sufficient classroom space to expand from 650 students to 900 students. There are 39 classrooms on the Pacific Beach campus, with six currently used for special education students, and one used to support the speech program as pull-out classes. This leaves six additional classrooms available presently for the school&#8217;s regular education students.

	<b><font size="4">BACKGROUND</font></b><font size="4">: On June 9, 2009, in closed session, the Board of Education agreed to pursue a 40-year, prepaid $20 million lease with the City for the district to lease two contiguous floors (sixth and seventh) of approximately 71,800 rentable square feet (Premises) to be used as a charter school educational facility. On June 23, 2009 in open session, the board approved a non-binding letter of intent with the City for a proposed charter school in the Library, which formed the basis for the Lease. With the City&rsquo;s prior written approval, the district may also use the Premises for other purposes, i.e., a private school or administrative or general business offices.<br />
	<br />
	The Library building is located at 11</font><sup><font size="4">th</font></sup><font size="4"> Street, Park Boulevard, J Street, and K Street in downtown San Diego (APN 535-362-16). The Lease term is for 40 years, with the one option to extend the term of the Lease for an additional ten (10) years at the then prevailing market rent. The district also has an option to purchase the premises at the end of the 10</font><sup><font size="4">th</font></sup><font size="4">, 20</font><sup><font size="4">th</font></sup><font size="4">, 30</font><sup><font size="4">th</font></sup><font size="4">, and 40</font><sup><font size="4">th</font></sup><font size="4"> years of the lease term. The purchase price for the Premises shall be the greater of: (1) the fair market value as of the date district exercises its purchase option; or the district proportional share of the actual building shell construction costs plus $13,964,000. This amount represents the land value of the Library, calculated by multiplying the 69,820 square feet of land comprising the Library multiplied by $200 per square foot. </font><br />
	<br />
	<font size="4">While Commencement of Construction is expected to be August 1, 2010, if Commencement of Construction fails to occur on or before August 1, 2011, the district may thereafter at any time deliver to City a notice of intent to terminate the Lease. The City, in its sole discretion and with notice to district, may decide not to commence construction of the library building shell. The Lease also provides for other options to terminate by either side. </font><br />
	<br />
	<font size="4">The City shall provide a first trust deed on non-Library property with a minimum value of $30 million until the end of the 10th Lease year, with the minimum value of $25 million during the next ten years, and thereafter the minimum value would be 125 percent of the unearned prepaid rent. </font><br />
	<br />
	<font size="4">The Lease states that the City may not begin construction of the building shell, and the district is not required to pay any rent until all of the following conditions are met: 1) City must set aside sufficient funds; 2) City must enter into a signed contract with a reputable, experienced construction manager at risk; 3) City must retain a general contractor who shall provide payment and performance bonds; 4) the City must purchase title insurance, at its own expense; 5) the Memorandum of Lease must be recorded; and 6) the first deed of trust on non-Library City property valued at must be recorded with the values specified in Lease.<br />
	<br />
	District will prepay the Initial Term (40 years) Rent in installments as follows: </font></p>
<ol type="1">
	<li>
		<font size="4">$5 million shall be paid on the Commencement of Construction;</font></li>
	<li>
		<font size="4">$5 million shall be paid when the Library is 25 percent complete, as certified by City&rsquo;s project architect; </font></li>
	<li>
		<font size="4">$5 million shall be paid when the Library is 50 percent complete, as certified by City&rsquo;s project architect; </font></li>
	<li>
		<font size="4">$3 million shall be paid when the Library is 75 percent complete, as certified by City&rsquo;s project architect; </font></li>
	<li>
		<font size="4">$2 million shall be paid upon Completion of Construction.</font></li>
</ol>
<br />
<p>
	<font size="4">District will be responsible for the cost of design and construction of its tenant improvements to its Premises, estimated at $10 million to be paid out of CCDC funds.<br />
	<br />
	This is a Triple Net Lease; district will be responsible for all operating expenses for its Premises and its proportionate share of the common area operating expenses for the Library. The district will be responsible for maintenance of the space it occupies and the City will be responsible for maintenance of the common areas. The City will also invoice district monthly for all sub-metered utilities, including a reasonable administrative fee for servicing the district&rsquo;s account.<br />
	<br />
	The district may rent up to 30 parking spaces in the Library parking facility. Parking passes will be valid from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm, Monday through Friday only. City will mark up to six contiguous parking spaces &ldquo;reserved&rdquo; for district&rsquo;s exclusive use. The current rental rate is $170 per parking pass per month.<br />
	<br />
	District may sublease its space with City&rsquo;s approval of subtenant and its use. Subleasing will not extend to any extension options. City will share in 50 percent of any subleasing profit.</font><br />
	<br />
	<font size="4">The Lease provides that the district shall have one official representative during the term of the 40 year lease on the City of San Diego Board of Library Commissioners. </font><br />
	<br />
	<font size="4">Upon approval of the Lease by both parties, the projected schedule is as follows: </font></p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>
		<font size="4">August 2012: City&rsquo;s completion of building shell structure (Phase I) </font></li>
	<li>
		<font size="4">Second quarter 2012: Commencement of district&rsquo;s tenant improvements</font></li>
	<li>
		<font size="4">January 2013: City&rsquo;s completion of building occupancy (Phase II) </font></li>
	<li>
		<font size="4">January 2013: Grand opening of Library </font></li>
	<li>
		<font size="4">September 2013: District occupancy</font></li>

The ICC reviews and recommends new courses, deletion of courses, and changes to approved courses to the Board of Education. It ensures that all courses are rigorous and provide students multiple pathways to graduation, college and career. The Committee is comprised of representatives from the following departments and divisions: Instructional Support Services; Research and Evaluation; Office of Language Acquisition; Special Education; Instructional Resources and Materials; Secondary School Improvement Office; Counseling and Guidance; Enrollment Options; Research and Reporting; College Career and Technical Education; Physical Education; Gifted and Talented Education; and Educational Technology.</span></span></p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The ICC approval process was revised during the 2009-10 school year. As a result, ICC approvals will come to the board twice a year. New courses will be presented to the board in April and final evaluations of pilots will be submitted to the board after the pilot has been completed, at the end of the school year.<br />

These five FTE positions have consistently been contracted out at an annual average cost of $1,314,472 per year. The Facilities Planning and Construction (FPC) reorganization plan, approved by the Board of Education on February 9, 2010, included these positions. All five positions will be funded by Proposition S. The total cost is estimated to be $579,989 per year, including benefits, for all five positions. Transitioning these positions to district employees will result in an annual savings of approximately $734,483.  </font><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">IMPACT TO DISTRICT STAFFING:  </font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Approval to establish the new Building Systems job classes will allow for the recruitment process to begin for three Building Systems Project Coordinator positions and two Senior Building Systems Project Manager positions.  </font><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">BACKGROUND:</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">  Over the past eight years, the Building Systems Engineering group (part of the Project Management Department within FPC) has exclusively used contracted personnel to monitor, schedule, coordinate, and install extensive technology, electrical, and mechanical systems, under the direction of a Project Management Supervisor. This has required a team of technically-diverse individuals with expertise in the areas of contract administration, project management, budget management, standards development, federal funding programs, and configuration of equipment, procurement of hardware/services, migration, commissioning, and training.  Additional duties also include conducting product reviews, feasibility studies and use of various procurement and construction contract processes. Once the systems are installed, this team will assume the responsibility for the acceptance and implementation of the systems.  i-21 funding of $344 million from Proposition S and $40 million from Federal E-rate is available to keep these positions funded through the 2013 calendar year.  An additional $835 million of Building Systems engineering work for Proposition S will keep Building Systems staff working from 2014 through 2018.  The cumulative knowledge and experience that these individuals have developed over the past several years is a valuable asset that should be leveraged by the district.  </font><br><br><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Office of the Deputy Superintendent</font></u></b><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">RECOMMENDATION:</font></b><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">1.

Authorize the execution of any documents necessary to effectuate the lease. (The terms of Agreement MA-IS-1040209 states that if any new equipment is a acquired by the district, the district enters into a separate and independent five-year lease for said equipment.)<br></font><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>FISCAL IMPACT:</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> The cost to lease the various IKON Color Production Multi-Function Devices included in this agreement is $7,070.56 per month, which equals $84,846.72 per year and a total cost of $424,233.00 for the term of the five-year agreement. However, with the new devices, the district would realize a net, one-year savings of $131,000.00 and a 60-month savings of $656,069.00 by having the capability to print color and special projects in-house and eliminating outsourcing of print jobs. No additional staffing will be required. This recommendation complies with the Revised Spending Freeze Guidelines dated November 4, 2009, as it is a services agreement. </font><p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">PRIOR YEAR EXPENSE HISTORY:</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> In 2008-09, the district spent approximately $16,000.00 on in-house color production jobs. More than $200,000.00 in color and special production print jobs were outsourced due to the fact that the district Printing Services did not have the necessary equipment to do the jobs. The outsourced jobs included but were not limited to the Enrollment Options catalog, the Facts for Parent handbook, the Budget Book, Breakfast in the Classroom laminated placemats, GAME On posters, and Attendance Boundaries maps. The cost to do the jobs in-house, if the Print Shop had the equipment included in this proposed agreement, would have been $84,000.00, for a net realized savings of $132,000.00. </font><p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">IMPACT TO DISTRICT STAFFING:</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> This authorization will provide district personnel with the opportunity to perform services in lieu of outside providers. <br></font><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>BACKGROUND:</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> California Public Contract Code 20118 provides that the district may purchase from contracts awarded by another district. The County of Los Angeles and IKON Office Solutions Inc., a Ricoh Company, have established a contract for the lease of various IKON Color Production Multi-Function Devices. The Printing Services Department supports district schools and departments with in-house printing of black and white materials as well as a limited number of in-house color printing jobs. Printing Services is fully-equipped for black and white printing but has only one color copier, limiting the capacity to fulfill all requests for color print jobs and resulting in the outsourcing of projects to outside vendors. In addition, orders for lamination, posters, banners, color postcards and other special requests cannot be filled by Printing Services and are also currently being outsourced.

The addition of the online web ordering system also opens the potential for the district to accept additional work from school-based foundations and/or other education-related outside entities which could add additional revenue for this department. The Communications Department will prepare and implement a communications and marketing program to widely inform district schools, departments, and outside entities about the availability of these new, cost-effective, printing services. </font><p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">[Originator/Contact: Bernie Rhinerson, Chief District Relations Officer, 619.725.5578, </font><a href="mailto:brhinerson@sandi.net"><u><font size="4" color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman">brhinerson@sandi.net</font></u></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">] </font><br><p><font size="4"> </font><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B4TU0BCA3A/$FILE/Cooperative%20Agreement%20No%20GD-90-1013-25.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B4TU0BCA3A/Body/0.1672?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="230" height="47" alt="Cooperative Agreement No GD-90-1013-25.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B4TU0BCA3A/$FILE/Color%20CashFlow%204-5-10.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B4TU0BCA3A/Body/0.26A2?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="132" height="47" alt="Color CashFlow 4-5-10.pdf" border="0"></a></div>

Integrated Technology Support Services (ITSS) will provide support to subject project. </font><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">BACKGROUND:</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> This is an agreement for the purchase of receiving, warehousing, distribution, inventory and asset management software and hardware to automate current processes. The district's current receiving, warehousing, distribution, inventory and asset management operations are entirely manual. While the district has, for years, been attaching asset tags with bar coding onto its 100,000 assets, there has never been any hardware to scan these bar codes and upload information into the district's asset management database. With the implementation of this system, Stock Clerks at Distribution Services will be able to identify inbound deliveries immediately upon receipt, and then scan serial numbers and the bar coding assigned to a district asset and upload this information into the PeopleSoft Receipt for the asset when processing the delivery. Distribution Services will be able to electronically track deliveries to schools and departments. Materiel Control will be able to complete the inventory of assets assigned to classrooms and offices in real time by using handheld devices that scan the bar codes on district asset tags and allow the user to identify the location's classroom or office number using an alphanumeric keypad. Currently each of these processes is paper-driven, with manual entry of data. This software system is integrated directly with the PeopleSoft eProcurement, Receipt, Inventory and Asset Management modules for seamless data flow and management. Because of High Jump's Certified Partner status with Oracle, the owner of PeopleSoft, the district is assured that the software seamlessly integrates with the district's existing PeopleSoft software, that it will not incur any additional cost to build and maintain an interface between two systems, and it will eliminate operational issues, thereby improving efficiency and effectiveness of district end users. </font><br><br><font face="Arial"></font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Originator/Contact: Drew Rowlands, Executive Director, Auxiliary Services, Office of the Superintendent, 858.627.7121, </font><a href="mailto:wrowlands@sandi.net"><u><font size="4" color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman">wrowlands@sandi.net</font></u></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font><p><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B4TX0BCA9D/$FILE/SV-90-1088-13%20HighJump%20Software%20End%20User%20Agreement.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B4TX0BCA9D/Body/0.F3C?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="293" height="47" alt="SV-90-1088-13 HighJump Software End User Agreement.pdf" border="0"></a></div>
