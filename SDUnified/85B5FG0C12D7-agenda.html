<div class="itembody"><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">RECOMMENDATION: </font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Approve Resolution Reducing or Eliminating Certain Certificated Services for the 2010-11 School Year.</font><p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">FISCAL IMPACT:</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> Approval and full implementation of this Resolution would result in a reduction in currently-performed certificated services, and a corresponding reduction in permanent and probationary certificated employees, sufficient to realize necessary budget reductions/savings in the event the March 1, 2010 tentative agreement between the District and the San Diego Education Association (&#8220;SDEA&#8221;) is not ratified by SDEA.</font><p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">PRIOR YEAR EXPENSE HISTORY:</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> N/A</font><p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">IMPACT TO DISTRICT STAFFING:</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> The Resolution provides for a reduction of certificated services totaling 973.5 full-time equivalents (FTEs).</font><p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">BACKGROUND: </font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The District is continuing to face a fiscal crisis. Approximately 80 percent of the District&#8217;s unrestricted budget is dedicated to staff (including salary and health and welfare benefit costs).  In order to maintain fiscal solvency, and in conjunction with the March 9</font><sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">th</font></sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> approval of a 2</font><sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">nd</font></sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> interim report, the District must take action to allow for significant reductions in certificated staffing consistent with prior Board actions and the plan/projections specified in the 2</font><sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">nd</font></sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> interim report.</font><p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">For permanent certificated employees the Education Code requires that the Board pass a resolution to identify the particular kinds of services or programs that may be reduced or eliminated in the upcoming fiscal year.  For probationary certificated employees Article 19 of the collective bargaining agreement between the District and SDEA allows the Board to determine that reductions are necessary due to lack of funds.  Permanent certificated staff potentially impacted by this action will be served with a statutory layoff notice on March 15, 2010.  Probationary certificated staff potentially-impacted by this action will be served with a contractual layoff notice on or before April 15, 2010.  Noticed employees will be able to challenge the action through a request for hearing (permanent) or the filing of a grievance (probationary).  Temporary certificated employees will receive a separate reminder notice that their services will end at the close of the 2009-10 school year.</font><p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In order to provide the necessary flexibility and still meet statutory and contractual deadlines, which are jurisdictional, this resolution lists a large number of programs many of which may ultimately not be reduced or eliminated if fiscal circumstances improve.  Additionally, based on the fact that the service reductions in the Resolution are FTEs rather than a number of employees, and other factors related to potentially disputed issues regarding seniority, certification, and qualifications for certain positions, the number of certificated employees receiving these notices will exceed the FTE service reductions listed in the Resolution.</font><p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">[Originator/Contact: Sandra Huezo, Chief Human Resources Officer, 619.725.7132, shuezo@sandi.net]</font><font size="4" face="Arial"> </font><p><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5FM0C12FD/$FILE/Certificated%20Layoff%20Resolution%20031410.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5FM0C12FD/Body/0.10BC?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="203" height="47" alt="Certificated Layoff Resolution 031410.pdf" border="0"></a><br><p></div>
