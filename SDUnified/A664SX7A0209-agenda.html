<div class="itembody"><p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>RECOMMENDATION: </strong>The Superintendent will provide information to the board and the public on Quality Leadership, Teaching and Learning (Vision 2020 Quality Indicator and corresponding LCAP Goal 3). &nbsp;This report will focus on implementation of the teacher pipeline, teacher effectiveness, leadership development and teacher career pathways.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="verdana, geneva, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><b>Vision 2020 Quality Indicator Destinations: </b></span></font></p>

<ul>
	<li><font face="verdana, geneva, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Quality Teaching:</strong> &nbsp; Effective teaching requires careful crafting of learning communities built on trust and respect, as well as routines, expectations, resources, and strategies that support diverse students&#39; intellectual engagement in learning. &nbsp;Effective teaching happens&nbsp;through&nbsp;thoughtful planning focused on defined outcomes for student learning and<b>&nbsp;</b>leveraging of teachable moments. &nbsp;Effective teaching is revealed in&nbsp;the ways in which teachers respond to the strengths and needs of individual students while engaging and supporting all students in their learning. &nbsp;Effective teaching is a form of inquiry wherein teachers use evidence and analysis of students&#39; strengths and struggles, and their own performance, to guide their practice in support of student learning. &nbsp;Effective teaching relies on engagement within a professional learning community. &nbsp;Teachers in California have a professional responsibility to provide students with safe and caring learning environments, where students&#39; differences are celebrated and supported, and they acquire the knowledge, skills, strategies, and concepts they will need for successful participation in an increasingly technological and global society. &nbsp;Teachers are personally aware of the role race plays in perpetuating a system of bias, prejudice, and inequity. &nbsp;</span></font><br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><font face="verdana, geneva, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Quality Leadership:</strong> &nbsp;Schools have a clear rationale, vision, and high expectations for achievement and immediacy for change in a positive and productive learning environment. &nbsp;School leaders collaborate with and motivate the school community providing support, sharing leadership, paying attention to the work and magnifying best practices using the appreciative inquiry lens. &nbsp;Schools know students&#39; learning needs and can recognize if instruction is improving student learning through classroom visits and analyzing data focused on student achievement. &nbsp;School leaders monitor belief systems and teach the importance of embracing diversity and respecting all cultures. &nbsp;The school community understands why change is important and collectively acts to ensure that all students have a quality education. &nbsp;Leaders positively influence the attitudes of students, staff, parents, and the community in setting high expectations for all students. &nbsp;Leaders bring systemic change towards a culture that embraces diversity, respects all cultures, and ensures the development and implementation of educational programs that maximize academic achievement of all students. &nbsp;Leaders are personally aware of the role race plays in&nbsp;perpetuating a system of bias, prejudice, and inequity. &nbsp;</span></font><br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><font face="verdana, geneva, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Professional Learning:</strong> &nbsp;Schools hold professional learning among their top priorities for the school community. &nbsp;They recognize that universal high expectations for all students require ambitious and continual improvements in curriculum, instruction, assessment, leadership practices and support systems. &nbsp;These improvements require effective professional learning to expand educators&#39; knowledge, skills, practices, and dispositions. &nbsp;Schools demand effective professional learning focused on substantive results for themselves, their colleagues, and their students. &nbsp;Schools artfully combine a&nbsp;deep understanding of and cultural responsiveness to the community they serve with high expectations and support for adult learning in order to achieve school and school system goals. &nbsp;They embed professional learning into the organization&#39;s vision by communicating that it is a core function for improvement and by establishing and maintaining a public and persistent focus on educator professional learning.</span></font></li>

The attached Board Policies (BP) and Administrative Regulations&nbsp;(AR)&nbsp;are the first group&nbsp;presented to the&nbsp;board for approval. &nbsp;Additional policies and regulations&nbsp;will be agendized&nbsp;for quarterly board approval until the district has adopted all applicable CSBA&nbsp;policies and regulations.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-family: verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">CONSULTATION WITH BOARD ADVISORY COMMITTEE:&nbsp;</span></span></strong><span style="font-family: verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">On November 17, 2016, the audit results were shared with the Independent Citizens' Oversight Committee (ICOC).</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-family: verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">BACKGROUND</span></span></strong><span style="font-family: verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">: On November 4, 2008, the voters of San Diego County approved, by more than the required 55 percent favorable vote, Proposition S, authorizing the issuance and sale of general obligation bonds, not to exceed $2,100,000,000. On November 6, 2012, the voters of San Diego County approved, by more than the required 55 percent favorable vote, Proposition Z, authorizing the issuance and sale of general obligation bonds, not to exceed $2,800,000,000.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">The passage of Proposition 39 in November 2000 amended the California Constitution to include accountability provisions. Specifically, the district must conduct an annual independent performance audit to ensure that funds have been expended only on the specific projects listed in the bond project list, as well as an annual independent financial audit of the proceeds from the sale of the bond until all of the proceeds have been expended for facilities projects.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">The results of the fiscal year 2015-16 Performance and Financial Audits were shared by Crowe Horwath&nbsp;with the Independent Citizens' Oversight Committee on November 17, 2016.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">In its financial audit, Crowe Horwath found that the district’s financial statements "present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the San Diego Unified School District Proposition&nbsp;S General Obligation Bonds and Proposition Z General Obligation Bonds activity as of June 30, 2016, and the respective changes in financial position for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America." This is the highest opinion that can be bestowed on the financial statements of a school bond program.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">In its performance audit, Crowe Horwath found that "in all significant respects, San Diego Unified School District met the objectives listed . . . and expended Proposition S & Z Bond funds for the year ended June 30, 2016 on for the specific projects developed by the District's Governing Board and approved by the voters, in accordance with the requirements of&nbsp;California Proposition 39, as specified by Section 1(b)(3)(C) of Article XIIIA of the California Constitution." This is the highest opinion that can be bestowed on an operational performance of a school bond program."&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">For the seventh consecutive year, the district's capital bond program has received the highest opinion auditors can offer for both its financial and performance audits. &nbsp;For the third consecutive year, the auditors made no adverse findings, a significant achievement for a bond program of this size and complexity.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>FISCAL IMPACT</strong>: The district&#39;s Fiscal Year 2016-17 Unrestricted General Fund, First Interim Report depicts a projected positive ending fund balance of $32.1M, with deficit spending of ($91.1M). This financial report was developed using various assumptions and projections as highlighted in the exhibit.&nbsp; The 2016-17 total General Fund Restricted and Unrestricted ending balance is $62.9M.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Assuming 2017-18 solutions are implemented, Fiscal Year 2017-18 Unrestricted General Fund indicates a positive ending fund balance of $30.6M with deficit spending of ($1.5M).&nbsp; The 2017-18 projected ending balance includes an estimated $116.6M in budget reductions.&nbsp; In accordance with the County Office of Education requirements, the district must have a plan for resolution of the budget shortfall by the time the Second Interim Report submittal on March 14, 2017.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>PRIOR YEAR FISCAL IMPACT</strong>: The district&#39;s Fiscal Year 2015-16 Unrestricted General Fund, First Interim Report depicted a projected positive balance of $72.4M, with deficit spending at ($71.7M).&nbsp; The 2015-16 General Fund Restricted and Unrestricted ending balance was $133.1M.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>IMPACT TO DISTRICT STAFFING</strong>: None. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>CONSULTATION WITH BOARD ADVISORY COMMITTEE: </strong>Not applicable.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>:&nbsp; On June 28, 2016, the board adopted the Fiscal Year 2016-17 budget, under the single budget adoption cycle. On September 13, 2016, the board approved the 2015-16 Unaudited Actuals Financial Report. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">California Education Code section 42130 requires the Board of Education approve the First Interim Report of the district&rsquo;s budgetary status as of October 31, on or before December 15. The board is also required to certify to the state that the district&rsquo;s projected financial condition at this point in time is one of the following: </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">a) Positive Certification - will be able to meet its financial obligations<br />
b) Qualified Certification - may not meet its financial obligations<br />
c) Negative Certification - will be unable to meet its financial obligations.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The projected decline in the ending balance and continued deficit spending indicate the need for budget actions to end deficit spending and re-establish the district&#39;s ending balance at a sustainable level. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">All other district funds outside of the General Fund are projected to meet their financial obligations for the current year. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>PRIOR YEAR FISCAL IMPACT</strong>: Each Independent Contractor Agreement represents a unique need and may not be an ongoing, year-over-year expense.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>IMPACT TO DISTRICT STAFFING</strong>: None.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>CONSULTATION WITH BOARD ADVISORY COMMITTEE: </strong>Not applicable.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>: In an effort to continue the improvement of procedures and processes for centralized procurement and contracting district&nbsp;wide, a new process will be implemented for streamlining Independent Contractor Agreements. The goal is to limit and reduce the number of contracted service items that are included in this item for approval via the ratification process. Ratification is an after-the-fact request for the board to approve services already provided or being provided at the time the Independent Contractors Agreement (ICA) is presented for approval.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Executive Leadership should work with requestors to reduce and eliminate the need for ratified ICA's. Effective immediately, after an ICA is submitted to and approved by the respective&nbsp;Executive Leadership/Instructional Cabinet team member, it will then be sent to the Strategic Sourcing and Contracts Department. The ICA will include a requisition number that pre-encumbers the funding for payment of the ICA after services are completed. After board approval, a purchase order will be created and sent to the contractor.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>BACKGROUND: &nbsp;</strong></span></span><span style="font-family:verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;">This program offers high achieving students the opportunity to fulfill high school graduation requirements while gaining college preparation skills and lower division transfer credit in science, technology, engineering, arts and math disciplines. The 2016-17&nbsp;program will be held at La Jolla, Mission Bay, Morse, Point Loma, San Diego, and University City high schools. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family:verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;">The courses will be taught by UCSD Extension instructors and will be made available to students on the high school campus outside of the regular instructional day. This program is grounded on the concept that academic rigor, combined with the opportunity to save time and money, is a powerful motivator for high school students to work hard in meeting the serious intellectual challenges of the future. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family:verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;">Participation in the program will provide students with the opportunity to increase the number of college credits they can earn while still in high school, make higher education more accessible, affordable, and attractive by bridging the divide between high school and college readiness, facilitate the transition of motivated high school students to higher education, create valuable opportunities to reach out to high school students, and challenge students to utilize their high school career in a fully productive manner. Because these courses are normally taken after earning admission to the University of California (UC) and to ensure the success of the pilot program, the courses will be held at district high schools that have existing necessary academic supports and high concentrations of students who are academically ready for UC-level coursework. To be eligible for the program, students must meet all high school level course prerequisites, take the SAT, ACT, or AP courses, pass Integrated Math 3 or Intermediate Algebra and complete the UC &#39;a-g&#39; course sequence<b>.</b></span></span><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-family:verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;">BACKGROUND</span></span></strong><span style="font-family:verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;">: &nbsp;<span style="color:black;">San Diego Unified School District in partnership with UCSD&nbsp;Extension will begin promoting and awarding achievement by issuing digital badges. These badges will recognize accomplishments like UC a-g completion, Dual Enrollment, College, Career, and Technical Education Pathway completion, Passing Advanced Placement (AP) and Smarter Balanced Exams, Grade Point Average, Attendance, and much more. Schools and courses of study (e.g. Biology, Algebra, or Automotive) will also be able to create badges to capture behaviors, skills, and competencies that are not always apparent in a letter grade. For example, these badges or micro credentials can indicate community service, or proficiency in CPR, biomedical lab techniques, automotive repair knowledge, etc. The badging system will be backed by UCSD, reviewed by local business partners and certain badges (micro-credentials) will be recorded on UCSD extension transcripts. We believe these badges will support students as they enter the post-secondary world of college and career by capturing what students can do, as well as what they know.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;">Badges are digital tokens that appear as icons or logos on a web page or other online venue. Awarded by institutions, organizations, groups, or individuals, badges signify accomplishments such as completion of a project, mastery of a skill, or marks of experience. Proponents suggest that these credentials herald a fundamental change in the way society recognizes learning and achievement—shifting from a traditional books-and-lecture pedagogy to a model with multiple knowledge streams, including new media, collaboration, interest-based learning, and project-based learning. &nbsp;As records of achievement, badges can recognize the completion of projects within a traditional college program or acknowledge experience gained through community efforts, online learning venues, or work-related projects.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>: On April 12, 2016, the board approved an Agreement with the Agency for Student Health Research, Inc. for a free trial of InjureFree software for the term&nbsp;April 13, 2016 and October 23, 2016. &nbsp;This&nbsp;initial free trial has been&nbsp;successful, and&nbsp;InjureFree&nbsp;has&nbsp;agreed to extend the free Pilot Program through June 30, 2017, in order to allow additional high schools in the district the opportunity to utilize the software. This new extension of the FREE trial will continue to provide InjureFree, athletic injury reporting system software to all&nbsp;district high schools at no cost. &nbsp;In addition, it will allow any authorized coach, athletic trainer, teacher, and school nurse&nbsp;with the opportunity&nbsp;to familiarize themselves with this&nbsp;software for athletic injury reporting.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">After the pilot program is over on June 30, 2017, the district will have the option to continue using the software&nbsp;at a negotiated discount&nbsp;rate of $.44 per student, which is a savings&nbsp;of 75 percent off the current list price.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">On October 25, 2016, the district's board of education approved an authorization to utilize the&nbsp;Harford County Public Schools, Maryland&nbsp;Cooperative Agreement with U. S. Communities and Gopher Sports in order to purchase physical education equipment, supplies, and uniforms. This authorization to utilize the Region 4 Education Service Center contract with The Cooperative Purchasing Network and BSN Sports, LLC&nbsp;will provide schools with additional opportunities to purchase physical education equipment, supplies, and uniforms in order to meet their&nbsp;needs; and schools&nbsp;will receive&nbsp;additional rebates and incentives on their&nbsp;purchases when purchasing from this contract. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">On July 8, 2014, the district's board of education received the final report from the Environmental Sustainability Advisory Committee.&nbsp; Included in this report as a "Dream Big" idea was a recommended action to join or create larger purchasing cooperatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;A purchasing cooperative establishes various contracts which aggregate the total purchases from many government entities resulting in lower costs to governmental entities who then utilize these contracts.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>CONSULTATION WITH BOARD ADVISORY COMMITTEE: </strong>Not applicable.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>: On March 8, 2016, the board approved a preliminary, non-binding MOU with the City of San Diego, identifying the district as an Implementing Partner for federal Promise Zone designation.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">The district participated in a partnership&nbsp;with the City of San Diego and Civic San Diego, the two lead applicants, and many other public and private organizations to apply&nbsp;for a Promise Zone designation. Promise Zones are a part of President Obama&#39;s&nbsp;plan to create a new pathway to the middle class by partnering with local communities and businesses to create jobs, increase economic security, improve educational opportunities, and reduce violent crime. San Diego&#39;s designation was announced on June 6, 2016. The area designated&nbsp;as the San Diego Promise Zone, which had to be contiguous and meet other qualifying criteria, includes much of Barrio Logan&nbsp;and the Diamond Community (see Exhibit B&nbsp;of the MOU for a map). </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">It is important to understand that this is not a grant program&mdash;there is no funding attached to the designation.&nbsp;However, designees receive preferred access to certain competitive federal investments that further their strategic plans, federal staff on the ground to help them implement their goals, and five, full-time AmeriCorps VISTA members to recruit and manage volunteers to strengthen the capacity of Promise Zone partners. The list of current partners, both implementing partners&mdash;those with major responsibility for one of the Promise Zone goals&mdash;and supporting partners is provided as Exhibit&nbsp;A to the MOU. Additional supporting partners may be added to work on initiatives related to any of the goals.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>CONSULTATION WITH BOARD ADVISORY COMMITTEE: &nbsp;</strong>Not applicable.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>: &nbsp;The school climate surveys for district students and staff consists of the California Healthy Kids Survey (CHKS) and the California Staff Climate Survey (CSCS) which will provide metrics as outlined in LCAP Goal 4: &nbsp;Positive School Environment, Climate, and Culture - With Equity at the Core and Support for the Whole Child.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The Counseling and Guidance Department will continue to work with WestEd to administer the CHKS and CSCS which will provide school climate data for all schools. Under the direction of the Family and Community Engagement Division, the California Staff Climate Survey and the Parent Survey will be simultaneously administered. &nbsp;The survey will include three components this year: students, staff and parents. The ability to have data from all three groups will be useful to determine aligned pro-active supports for schools and clusters. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The California Healthy Kids Survey&nbsp;provides data on resiliency, protective factors, and risk behaviors. &nbsp;The CHKS&nbsp;supports the understanding between students&#39; health behaviors and academic performance. &nbsp; Census administration will occur in Grades 4 (Point Loma cluster), 5, 7, 9, and 11. &nbsp;Last year students at the secondary level took an additional survey (Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network ([GLSEN]) specific to </span></span><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer/Questioning, Intersex, and Asexual (LGBTQIA) </span></span></span></span><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">concerns.&nbsp; To ensure alignment this year, as a district, we are including this extra component into The California Healthy Kids Survey. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The California Staff Climate Survey&nbsp;provides a means to obtain staff perceptions about learning and teaching conditions in order to make informed decisions about professional development, instruction, and the implementation of learning supports. &nbsp;The Parent Survey assesses the experiences and views of parents related to school climate, student achievement and parent outreach in comparison to staff and student perspectives. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Underlying the survey is research and theory supporting the importance of fostering school environments that are academically challenging, caring, participatory, safe, and healthy.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>CONSULTATION WITH BOARD ADVISORY COMMITTEE:&nbsp; </strong>Not applicable.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>:&nbsp; This amendment and upgrade to BoardDocs Plus will provide the capacity to add each board advisory committee with separate document managers and administrator access in BoardDocs. All agendas, exhibits, and minutes of each board advisory committee will be available to the public in the same manner as the board's public meeting agendas, exhibits, and minutes. BoardDocs Plus allows for electronic distribution of all advisory committee materials, saves time, resources, is searchable, and will provide for a more efficient use of staff time.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Upon board approval of the amendment, the following board advisory committees will transition to BoardDocs Plus in 2017:</span></span></p>

	<li><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Community Advisory Committee on Special Education (CAC)</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">District Advisory Council on Compensatory Education (DAC)</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC)</span></span></li>

</ul>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">In September 2007, the board approved a two-year agreement with Emerald Data Solutions to begin implementation of a paperless, web-based, e-Governance board agenda solution to enhance better communication with the public and to quickly and efficiently allow access to agendas and related information with searchable archives. In March 2008, the board went live with the BoardDocs paperless agenda. </span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">In September 2011, and on October 14, 2014, the board approved three and five-year agreements with Emerald Data Solutions for BoardDocs respectively through December 31, 2019. </span></span></p>

These actions provide the means by which the board of education can access income which becomes available to them after they have adopted a final budget, or adjust income based on current information. When such added income is available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use, the action to accept, budget, and spend the income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and supporting budget.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">This report includes AB&amp;S items and rescissions that resulted in a net negative total of $72.2 million:</span></span></p>

	<li><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Rescission of ($34.4) million in the original budget to decrease the beginning balance for the DoDEA grants received for Miller and Hancock.&nbsp; Funds were unspent and deferred at the end of the 2015-16 fiscal year.&nbsp; Beginning balance for 2016-17 was reduced and income was recognized in 2016-17.</span></span></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Pursuant to the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing Leaflet CL-5330 (10/14), Emergency CLAD permits may be reissued to an applicant two times, authorizing a maximum of three years of service.&nbsp; Teaching or service authorized by an Emergency CLAD Permit is restricted to schools operated by the employing agency that requests the permit.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>FISCAL IMPACT</strong>:&nbsp; Total not-to-exceed amount: $781,000.00.&nbsp; Budget string: 9650-81505-00-6200-8100-0000-01000-0000.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>CONSULTATION WITH BOARD ADVISORY COMMITTEE:&nbsp; </strong>Not applicable.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>: This&nbsp;project&nbsp;installs upgrades to the existing vehicle wash facility, located at 4770 <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Cardin">Cardin</span> Street.&nbsp; The&nbsp;project includes installation of new equipment and associated electrical power, a water softener system, a reverse osmosis system and reclaimed water system.&nbsp; The project will also include installation of new trench drains in the equipment room, drainage improvements at steam wash area in the chassis wash bay, and drainage improvements at northwest corner of the property.&nbsp; The purpose of this project is to modernize the existing bus wash facility. The California Highway Patrol continuously inspects the Transportation Department's vehicles and is required by law to remove from service&nbsp;any vehicle that is dirty or leaking oil. Cleaning of buses will both increase the resale value and extend the lifespan of district buses by minimizing the rust and corrosion associated with chlorides and dirt. Regular cleaning will lower the vehicle weight by washing debris, such as mud, off the undercarriage and wheel wells. The added weight from the debris causes unnecessary wear and tear, increased fuel consumption, increased operating costs, and reduced vehicle lifespan. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Pursuant to Public Contract Code section 20111 (b), the district must publicly competitively bid any public project involving an expenditure of $15,000 or more.&nbsp; The notice calling for bids was published once a week for two successive weeks in accordance with Public Contract Code section 20112.&nbsp; Bids were solicited on October 12, 2016.&nbsp; Bids were received from Conan Construction Inc., Grahovac Construction Company Inc., Fordyce Construction Inc., Handy Industrial, Khavari Construction Inc., and Willkom Inc.&nbsp; Conan Construction Inc. has been determined to be the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">On May 10, 2011, the board approved a resolution in support of service-disabled, veteran-owned businesses (SDVOB) and disabled, veteran business enterprises (DVBE) which established a 3 percent required participation of DVBE’s for all district construction contracting opportunities.&nbsp; The recommended contractor, Conan Construction Inc. submitted a 7 percent DVBE participation in its bid. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The existing transportation center, including the existing bus wash facility, are covered by a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), Industrial Storm Water General Permit (WDID No. 9 37 I 000877).&nbsp; All proposed improvements to the existing bus wash facility would not affect compliance with the conditions of the existing NPDES Permit.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The proposed activity is a project under CEQA, Public Resources Code (PRC) section 21000 et. seq., and its implementing Guidelines (California Code of Regulations, Title 14, Division 6, Chapter 3, sections 15000 et. seq., as amended). The project, however, is categorically exempt from expanded environmental review under section 15301 – Existing Facilities. On September 13, 2016, the board approved and authorized staff to file a Notice of Exemption. On October 3, 2016, a Notice of Exemption for the project was filed with the San Diego County Recorder/Clerk and is included as Attachment 1.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Phase 2:&nbsp; Expedite the installation of air conditioning systems in classrooms and other primary use spaces at schools in Climate Zones 1 and 2, and expedite the installation of air conditioning in all the remaining, qualifying education spaces at Climate Zone 3 schools.&nbsp; Design and construction activities have begun in early 2016, and are to be completed by 2019.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">On November 10, 2015, the board approved the Expedited Air Conditioning Phase 2 Plan.&nbsp; To accomplish the Phase 2 plan, Facilities, Planning, and Construction has packaged the scopes of work into four regions and will bid and award each region separately.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">This project consists of furnishing and installing HVAC and all associated work at district school sites in Region 2.&nbsp; The schools in Region 2 include but are not limited to the following: Andersen-Muir ATYP, Bay Park ES, Chesterton ES, Clairemont HS, Crown Point ES, Cubberley ES, Jones ES, Juarez ES, Kearny HS, Lindberg-Schweitzer ES, Marston MS, Ross ES, Toler ES, Wegeforth ES, Whittier-Del Sol Academy, Wiggin-Mt. Everest Academy ATYP.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Pursuant to Public Contract Code section 20111 (b), the district must publicly competitively bid any public project involving an expenditure of $15,000 or more.&nbsp; The notice calling for bids was published once a week for two successive weeks in accordance with Public Contract Code section 20112.&nbsp; Bids were due and opened on November 16, 2016.&nbsp; The district received a total of 2 bids from Angeles Contractor, Inc. and Solpac Construction, Inc. dba Soltek Pacific Construction Company.&nbsp; After evaluating the bids staff determined Solpac Construction, Inc. dba Soltek Pacific Construction Company to be the low responsive and responsible bidder.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">On May 10, 2011, the board approved a resolution in support of service-disabled, veterans-owned businesses (SDVOB) and disabled, veteran business enterprises (DVBE) which established a 3 percent required participation of DVBE’s for all district construction contracting opportunities.&nbsp; The recommended contractor, Solpac Construction, Inc. dba Soltek Pacific Construction Company submitted a 3.1 percent DVBE participation in its bid.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>CONSULTATION WITH BOARD ADVISORY COMMITTEE: </strong>Not applicable.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>: The City of San Diego owns property adjacent to district-owned Darnall Charter School (Darnall Charter). The City property is land-locked with no vehicular access other than across Darnall Charter. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">On October 25, 2016 (Item I.40.), the board approved encroachment agreements with AT&T, Crown Castle and T-Mobile. This Agreement with Verizon Wireless uses the exact same language and terms.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Verizon has a long-term agreement with the City for use of the City-owned property for their wireless communication facilities. This Agreement provides authorization for Verizon the continued right of ingress and egress, via an existing road which crosses a portion of Darnall Charter, to access its wireless communication facilities. Additionally, this Agreement provides:</span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">A five-year term at a rate of five thousand dollars ($5,000) annually, with 3 percent increases beginning on November 1, 2017; </span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">A stipulation that any access during school hours requires a ”check-in” with the school office; and</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Agreement can be terminated by the district within thirty (30) days if Verizon terminates its agreement with the City.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Darnall Charter’s Associate Director of Communications and Operations, Dr. Consuelo Manriquez, approved this agreement. Dr. Consuelo’s predecessor, Dawna Halama, has reported to staff that there have been no issues in the past with Verizon Wireless using the school site to access the City property.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-family:verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;">BACKGROUND</span></span></strong><span style="font-family:verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;">: To allow for efficiency in the administration of a large urban school district, California Education Code section 17605 specifically allows a school district to delegate limited purchasing power, i.e., for purchases no greater than $87,800 (for the year 2016) for supplies, materials, apparatus, equipment and non-construction services; for purchases less than $15,000 for construction services; and for contracts, leases or other documents no greater than $87,800 (for the year 2016) for supplies, materials, apparatus, equipment and non-construction services as long as each transaction is below the competitive bidding threshold under Public Contract Code section 20111. The purchase orders, contracts, leases, or other documents are binding on the district once the employee delegated by the board has entered into those purchase orders, contracts, leases or other documents. For this reason, these types of transactions must be reviewed by the board within 60 days of the date of the transaction under Education Code section 17605. Pursuant to the authority delegated to the district Strategic Sourcing and Contracts Officer on June 14, 2016, these purchase orders have been released to the respective vendors and are being submitted for review by the board at this time. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family:verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;">Thus, the district has met the requirements of Education Code section 17605 with this process of reporting out the specified purchase orders under $87,800 (for the year 2016) that are not associated with any previously-approved board contracts.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>:</span></span><span style="color: rgb(31, 78, 121);">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">The City of San Diego is implementing a new technology to combat gun violence with the use of ShotSpotter. This is a gunshot detection system that the San Diego Police Department (SDPD) would like to use to improve safety in the communities of southeastern San Diego, which include communities where district schools are located and where many district students live.&nbsp; ShotSpotter utilizes a network of specialty sensors to detect the sound of a gunshot, accurately identify the location of the gunshot, and quickly communicate this information to police patrol vehicles.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">SDPD is requesting to locate six ShotSpotter sensors on district facilities to improve the coverage area of the ShotSpotter system.&nbsp; The locations of the sensors will be determined in further discussion with SDPD.&nbsp; The sensors are small and unobtrusive, with negligible impact to district facilities. The sensors are acoustic devices that are tuned to, and only activate by, loud impulsive sounds.&nbsp; The system does not infringe upon personal privacy as there is no live listening nor the opportunity to listen in on or record conversations.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">The ShotSpotter system is for use by SDPD and there is no connection or feed to the San Diego Unified Police Department.&nbsp; In the event of a gunshot near a school, school police would be notified by SDPD through normal police communication channels, just as they are now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
