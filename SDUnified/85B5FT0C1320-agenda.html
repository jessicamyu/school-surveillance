The State General Fund revenue is unstable and erratic resulting in unpredictable funding levels for school districts.  If a local parcel tax measure is approved by the voters, the revenue from the parcel tax can provide a stable, predictable source of school revenue.  Placement of the Local Control of Local Classrooms Funding Act on the November 2010 ballot, and subsequent approval of the initiative in November 2010, would allow local school districts to pass a parcel tax measure with support by 55 percent of the voters.  The local community could directly support their schools with local resources to fund important educational programs and initiatives including, but not limited to, attracting and retaining qualified teachers, retaining smaller class sizes, supporting strong core academic programs, and maintaining art, music, physical education, athletics, and student support programs.</font><br><font size="4"> </font><br><font size="4">[Originator/Contact:  Board of Education Members, board@sandi.net, 619.725.5550] </font><br><br><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5GY0C13C7/$FILE/Board%20Resolution%20Local%20Control%20of%20Classrooms%20Funding%20Act%20021910.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5GY0C13C7/Body/0.CA0?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="339" height="47" alt="Board Resolution Local Control of Classrooms Funding Act 021910.pdf" border="0"></a></div>

A large number of Johnson students continue at Johnson and promote at sixth grade.  Students at both fifth and sixth grade make a variety of school choices at the end of their Johnson career.  Johnson&#8217;s neighborhood middle school is Mann Middle School.  When applications are received by February 15, Johnson students receive continuity priority application status to attend Millennial Tech Middle (MTM), a dedicated STEM magnet.  Johnson students also choose other magnet, Voluntary Enrollment Exchange Program (VEEP), School Choice and Program Improvement School Choice (PISC) options and neighboring charters.  </font><p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Capacity at Millennial Tech Middle is limited. There are a total of 180 to 200 seats per grade level for at total capacity of up to 600 students.  Millennial Tech Middle is successfully recruiting students for the sixth grade class.  Very few students attending MTM leave during their middle school career, therefore very few (5 to 20) seats, are available at seventh grade for incoming students.  Johnson parents respect the success of MTM and want to be sure that all Johnson students interested in continuing their education with an emphasis in STEM have that opportunity.  </font><p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">At this time, Johnson fifth grade students interested in continuing at Johnson for sixth grade receive continuity priority application status for seventh grade seats at MTM when are made following School Choice application deadlines. Available seats at MTM may not allow all students who apply with continuity to be offered enrollment at seventh grade.  Johnson has approximately 60 sixth grade students each year and classroom space at Millennial is limited. </font><p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The STEM magnet schools&#8217; articulation plan includes Johnson STEM Magnet (K-5) and Webster Science and Research Magnet (K-6) to Millennial Tech Middle School, a dedicated magnet with continuity priority application (6-8), to a series of high school options that includes Lincoln Center for Science and Engineering (9-12).</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">  </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Lincoln High School Cluster has embraced the STEM education opportunities.

The families have been provided an extension of the regular School Choice deadline and the office will work to assist the families with their school preferences. We have also contacted and extended the deadline to sixth grade families because of the limited number of seats available at MTM.  </font><p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Staff and Community Engagement:</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">  Johnson staff expressed concern regarding the limited number of seats available for their students at MTM.  They voted as a group to support the reconfiguration to K-5.  Three community meetings were held to hear comments regarding the configuration.

Johnson STEM fifth grade students have continuity priority to attend MTM STEM magnet and are selected first when they apply by the School Choice deadline of February 15.

This transportation is due to the Gompers conversion to a charter school, therefore Mann became the district neighborhood middle school.

In order to provide the necessary flexibility, this resolution lists a large number of programs, many of which, ultimately, may not be reduced or eliminated.</font><p><font size="4">[Originator/Contact: Sandra Huezo, Chief Human Resources Officer, 619.725.7132, shuezo@sandi.net]</font></div>

<div class="itembody"><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">RECOMMENDATION:  </font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Approve a revised board action regarding projected budget savings from Small High Schools that was included on the Board List of Proposed Budget Solutions approved by the board on February 23, 2010.  The revised board action would be as follows:</font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The board directs the Superintendent to develop operational plans at the San Diego High Educational Complex and the Crawford High Educational Complex site to achieve budget savings of approximately $295,000.  These operational plans are to be developed by the school leadership, teachers, and parent community with the goal of refocusing educational programs at these schools to increase student achievement and to create operational efficiencies to reduce overall costs.</font><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">FISCAL IMPACT:  </font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">On February 23, 2010, the board approved targeted savings of $295,728 from consolidation at small high schools.  This recommendation retains that projected budget savings be included in budget projections for the 2010-11 budget.</font><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">PRIOR YEAR EXPENSE HISTORY:  </font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">None.</font><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">IMPACT TO DISTRICT STAFFING:  </font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Each school site will develop a plan that may include staffing adjustments.  The board will act on those plans with specific budget savings and staffing impacts in May, prior to the adoption of a final district budget for 2010-11.</font><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">BACKGROUND:  </font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">During the budget hearing on February 23, 2010, the board approved a list of specific budget reduction items which included a reduction of $295,728 that would result from consolidations at San Diego High and the Crawford High.  Subsequent to this board action, Board Members Barrera and Jackson, together with the Interim Superintendent and staff, have held several meetings with site principals and teachers at both schools.  The goal of these meetings was to clarify that it was the board&#8217;s intent that each school would be allowed to develop a new operational plan to achieve budget savings and which would strengthen overall focus on increasing student achievement levels.  The Interim Superintendent has set a timeline for the operational plans to be completed for board review in May, before the final adoption of the budget for next year.</font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Principals and the teaching staff have reacted positively to this approach and appreciate the opportunity to engage their school communities in this effort.  This approach retains the board&#8217;s direction to achieve budget savings but gives each school site the challenge to find news ways to serve students more efficiently.  The Interim Superintendent will continue to provide necessary resources to these schools to support this planning effort and will return to the board for review and approval of these site organization plans in May.</font><p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">[Originator/Contact:  Board of Education Trustees Richard Barrera and Shelia Jackson, board@sandi.net, 619.725.5550] </font></div>

To allow for efficiency in the administration of a large urban school district, California Education Code section 17605 specifically allows a school district to delegate limited purchasing power, i.e., for purchases no greater than $78,500 (for the year 2010) for supplies, materials, apparatus, equipment, and non-construction services as long as each transaction is below the competitive bidding threshold under Public Contract Code section 20111.  The purchase orders are binding on the district once the employee delegated by the Board has entered into those purchase orders. For this reason, these types of transactions must be reviewed by the board within 60 days of the date of the transaction under Education Code section 17605. Pursuant to the authority delegated to the district's Strategic Sourcing and Contracts Officer on June 23, 2009, these purchase orders have been released to the respective vendors and are being submitted for review by the board at this time. <br><br>Thus, the district has met the requirements of Education Code section 17605 with this process of reporting out the specified purchase orders under $78,500 (for the year 2010) that are not associated with any previously-approved board contracts. <br><br>[Originator/Contact: Arthur S.

The term of the First Amendment is April 15, 2010 through April 14, 2011.</font><b><font size="4"><br><br>FISCAL IMPACT: </font></b><font size="4">The original Agreement provides for two, one-year renewals. Ramona Paving and Construction Corp, Inc. has agreed to honor its current contract pricing, with no price increases during the term of the First Amendment to Agreement. The contract value is $1.2 million. Budget string: 9609 77102 00 5751 8500 0000 35000 0000.</font><b><font size="4"><br><br>PRIOR YEAR EXPENSE HISTORY: </font></b><font size="4">Original contract expense history: April 14, 2009 to January 5, 2010: work in the amount of $1,326,588 has been assigned to the contractor.</font><b><font size="4"><br><br>IMPACT TO DISTRICT STAFFING: </font></b><font size="4">The project does not require district personnel to perform services. Services will be performed by the contractor. </font><b><font size="4"><br><br>BACKGROUND:</font></b><font size="4"> One of the largest physical assets within district&#8217;s physical plant is asphalt pavement. The system includes playgrounds, parking lots, driveways, walkways, drainage swales and ramps totaling more than 21 million square feet. The current replacement value of the system exceeds $100 million. This physical asset must be maintained to minimize the cost of ownership. Asphalt deteriorates from exposure to weather (heat, rain, etc.) mechanical wear (such as dirt and grit, vehicle and foot traffic) and environmental impacts (rodents, fluids from vehicles, underlying soil failures). This maintenance plan addresses these conditions and extends the asset service life, maximizing return on investment in a cost effective manner. </font><p><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Maintenance Strategy</font></u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> <br>Physical Plant Operations (PPO) maintains and repairs the district&#8217;s asphalt systems utilizing in-house and contract resources. Primary aspects of the asphalt maintenance program include: planned maintenance (PM) and reactive maintenance (site-generated repair orders). Planned maintenance (PM) is the most predictable and cost-effective method of maintaining a usable and appropriate surface for students and staff. PPO supports a four-year maintenance cycle that includes some combination of asphalt repair, slurry seal and line striping for every district asset. Reactive maintenance consists mainly of small, isolated asphalt repairs and safety concerns such as potholes and cracks. Each year the planned maintenance work of PPO is evaluated for updates and improvements. After analysis of the previous year&#8217;s operations and other variables, specific crews will be assigned to seal coat work and the non-routine asphalt work. With this separation, a seal coat crew of three to four professional district staff and seal coat equipment can re-seal 25 percent of the district each year, visiting every district site in a four year cycle. The cost of sealing the asphalt is approximately 4 percent of the cost of removal and replacement and is by far the most economical way to preserve and maximize the life cycle of this district asset. There will be in-house crews working to prepare and repair damaged areas prior to seal coat at each of the sites as required. Ramona Paving will be contracted to accomplish projects where the district does not have current or foreseeable capacity. For fiscal year 2009-10, the value of the work to be accomplished by contracting is projected to be $1.7 million (see Attachment A). By separating the project work into seal coat and repair, to better utilize in-house capacity, we are projecting a need for only $961,000 of contract asphalt repair work in fiscal year 2010-11 (Attachment B).</font><font size="4"><br></font><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>Workload</font></u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> <br>California Public Contracting Code 20114 requires the district to contract projects that exceed 750 labor hours or $21,000 in material costs (Force Account).  IDIQ contracts provide predictable delivery and costs for projects. This contract will only be utilized after the in-house forces are at capacity or the scope of the project exceeds force account requirements. The Asphalt Service Schedule (Attachment B) represents 5.2 million square feet of asphalt to be serviced within the next year, at a cost of $2.3 million. This schedule fully utilizes PPO crews, executing $1.3 million of asphalt maintenance. </font><font size="4"><br></font><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>Summary</font></u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>This contract was publicly bid and awarded to Ramona Paving and Construction Corp. Inc., on April 14, 2009, providing asphalt repairs, paving and seal coating at various district sites on an as-needed basis (IDIQ). Contract duration is one year, with option to renew for an additional two, one-year terms (for a total of three years) with the initial term completion of April 14, 2010. This contract is for work to be performed on an as-needed basis, with individual projects or tasks ranging anywhere from $10,000 to $250,000 in value. PPO uses this contract to complete projects that it cannot perform in-house due to size (exceeding the district&#8217;s force account) or scheduling conflicts.</font><font size="4"><br></font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>Ramona Paving and Construction Corp, Inc. is an established contractor, is qualified to perform this work, and continues to provide quality services to the district.<br><br>Per Public Contract Code section 20111(b) a school district is required to competitively bid a public works project valued at $15,000 or more. Per Public Contract Code Section 20114, the district must contract this work because it exceeds the force account limitations for performing the work with in-house forces.<br><br>[Originator/Contact: Drew Rowlands, Executive Director, Auxiliary Services, Office of the Chief Financial Officer, 858.627.7121, </font><a href="mailto:wrowlands@sandi.net"><u><font size="4" color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman">wrowlands@sandi.net</font></u></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">] </font><p><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5KV0C1E4A/$FILE/C89-202-LH%20First%20Amendment-%20Ramona%20Paving.rev.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5KV0C1E4A/Body/0.1BAC?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="264" height="47" alt="C89-202-LH First Amendment- Ramona Paving.rev.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5KV0C1E4A/$FILE/ATT0W7SX/c89-202%20contract.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5KV0C1E4A/Body/0.2972?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="107" height="47" alt="c89-202 contract.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5KV0C1E4A/$FILE/ATTBMNKC/attachment-a.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5KV0C1E4A/Body/0.3330?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="88" height="47" alt="attachment-a.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5KV0C1E4A/$FILE/Attachment-B.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5KV0C1E4A/Body/0.3C6C?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="88" height="47" alt="attachment-b.pdf" border="0"></a></div>
