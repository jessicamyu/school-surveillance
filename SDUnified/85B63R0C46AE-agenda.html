The community established a Point Loma Cluster Foundation to provide resources to their cluster schools.  Most recently the Point Loma Cluster has met to address budget issues, specifically the Point Loma Cluster Schools' budgets.  The Point Loma Cluster believes they have unique needs that require budgetary involvement and shared resources to accomplish the cluster goals, the community is interested in establishing a means to combine cluster school resources and make recommendations on how best to serve the cluster children.  For that reason, the Point Loma Cluster is recommending, and Board Member de Beck is requesting, a pilot program to combine the budgets of all the Point Loma Cluster Schools and that the Cluster community leadership and school governance groups have an opportunity to recommend specific budget sharing solutions to the board.  The Point Loma Cluster has no expectation that the school board would increase any allocations beyond those that could be expected without a cluster budget agreement. </font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Cluster School governance would agree to the terms described in the attached Memorandum of Understanding, and that no decisions recommended by the Cluster School governance would violate existing district operational rules and guidelines.  Final approval of the Cluster Governance Pilot Project would include an agreement for a process to evaluate the Cluster Budget Pilot.   </font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">[Originator/Contact: John de Beck, Board Member, 619.725.5550, jdebeck1@san.rr.com]</font><br><br><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B64W0C478B/$FILE/Cluster%20Budget%20MOU.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B64W0C478B/Body/0.ED2?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="123" height="47" alt="Cluster Budget MOU.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B64W0C478B/$FILE/CLUSTER%20BUDGET%20PILOT.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B64W0C478B/Body/0.1C74?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="158" height="47" alt="CLUSTER BUDGET PILOT.pdf" border="0"></a></div>

The survey sought voter opinions about a hypothetical parcel tax measure with various tax levels and sought opinions about challenges facing the district and about various educational programs. An analysis of the survey results will be presented to the board during the meeting along with the topline findings.</font><p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The next steps in this project will be to develop alternative parcel tax proposals that identify specific uses for these funds during the identified time funding would be available (5-7 years). Working with the Primacy Group, the Chief District Relations Offer will coordinate input from district academic leadership on optional uses for this emergency educational funding. Alternative approaches to this educational fee will also be developed. The Primacy Group will also work to solicit community input about the educational fee alternatives.</font><p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In April, staff will return to the board with another informational update and a presentation on various parcel tax/educational fee options.

One company, the 4VISUAL MEDIA Group (www.4visualmedia.com) will be present at the board meeting to discuss their services. A general overview proposal from this company is attached which projects a potential annual revenue for individual schools in their program of $40,000 or more, annually. </font><p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In addition to school site advertising, staff also seeks board approval to explore revenue generating sponsorships for the district and school websites. With annual visitor traffic in excess of 1 million visits per month, the district website has the potential to generate significant revenues from sponsorship and limited advertising. With board direction, staff will continue to explore this opportunity and develop a proposal for board consideration at a future meeting. The Chief District Relations Officer will present examples of possible website sponsorship ads at this board meeting. </font><p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The concept of school sponsorships and advertising is not new, but to date it has not been tapped as a source of revenue for the district. Individual schools often do fundraising that provides corporate recognition ads in school publications and event signage. The programs envisioned here, however, are broader-based and will be carefully managed by the district to secure quality sponsorships and advertisements that can generate significant revenues.

This project was conducted by district staff from the Instructional Support Services Division, principals, school improvement officers, and local univesity faculty to identify common threads found in nine high-poverty district schools where students are making significant gains in achievement.  The schools included in the project were:  Birney, Edison, Garfield, and Joyner elementary schools; Correia, Lewis, Marston, and Roosevelt middle schools and Madison High School.  The 2008 API at each of these schools is in excess of 650, and the 2009 API at most of these schools is in excess of 700. </font><p><font size="4">It was determined that common threads at all of these schools include:  strong leadership; collaboration; consistency; high expectations; strong and effective organizational structure; consistent student management; positive staff visibility; and use of DataDirector.</font><p><b><font size="4">FISCAL IMPACT:  </font></b><font size="4">None.</font><p><b><font size="4">PRIOR YEAR EXPENSE HISTORY:   </font></b><font size="4">None.</font><p><b><font size="4">IMPACT TO DISTRICT STAFFING:  </font></b><font size="4">None.</font><p><b><font size="4">BACKGROUND:  </font></b><font size="4">The district's interest in deepening its understanding of the practices, principles, and processes that have influenced success in our very own schools led to the implementation of Project Schools Making a Difference.  In fall 2009, the Deputy Superintendent requested that district staff conduct a study of our successful schools to identify what they are doing to realize significant gains in student achievement.  Teams of three visited each of the sites and conducted classroom observations; interviewed teachers, students, administration, and parents; and analyzed site achievement data.  The teams also examined instructional programs, cultural and learning environments, school improvement efforts, and organizational structure.</font><p><font size="4">[Originator/Contact:  David Lorden, Director, Professional Development for Administrative Support &amp; Integrated Teams, Instructional Support Services Division, Office of the Deputy Superintendent, 619.725.7269, dlorden@sandi.net]</font><p><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B65H0C4AF8/$FILE/Project%20Schools%20Making%20a%20Difference,%201-26-10.ppt"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B65H0C4AF8/Body/0.CF2?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="241" height="47" alt="Project Schools Making a Difference, 1-26-10.ppt" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B65H0C4AF8/$FILE/Project%20Schools%20Making%20a%20Difference,%201-26-10.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B65H0C4AF8/Body/0.1CC0?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="241" height="47" alt="Project Schools Making a Difference, 1-26-10.pdf" border="0"></a></div>

<div class="itembody"><b><font size="4">RECOMMENDATION: </font></b><font size="4"> Conduct public hearing and approve General Waiver Request to the California Department of Education for Roosevelt Middle School to raise class size targets required in the Quality Education Investment Act (QEIA) for Grade 6 from 15.9 to 20.9, and Grade 7 from 15.7 to 20.7.</font><p><b><font size="4">FISCAL IMPACT:</font></b><font size="4"> There is no fiscal impact associated with conducting a public hearing or submitting the waiver request.</font><p><b><font size="4">PRIOR YEAR EXPENSE HISTORY: </font></b><font size="4"> None.</font><p><b><font size="4">IMPACT TO DISTRICT STAFFING:</font></b><font size="4">  None.</font><p><b><font size="4">BACKGROUND: </font></b><font size="4"> Roosevelt Middle School has been in Program Improvement (PI) for six years.  Roosevelt's Program Improvement Plan included reduced class sizes in key content areas. In 2006-07, the district provided additional teachers to the school, in addition to those allocated by the district's formula, to help the school implement the class size component of their Program Improvement Plan.  Roosevelt's 2006-07 baseline of 20.9 for Grade 6 and 20.7 for Grade 7 was already significantly lower than a typical middle school when they began receiving QEIA funding.  (This waiver does not affect the Grade 8 target).  The facilities at Roosevelt cannot accommodate a further reduction in class size.</font><p><font size="4">Due to the state budget situation, the funds that were provided by the district to reduce class size at Roosevelt in 2006-07 are no longer available.   Additionally, to balance the 2009-10 budget, the district raised class sizes at all grade levels, thus reducing the number of teachers allocated to the school by the district's formula.</font><p><font size="4">In April 2009, Roosevelt teachers voted favorably to raise class size targets to 20.9 for Grade 6 and 20.7 for Grade 7.  The Roosevelt teachers' vote was followed by a presentation to the school's site council, which also agreed with the proposal to raise the QEIA ratios as stated in the waiver request.</font><p><font size="4">On several occasions in spring and summer 2009, the San Diego Education Association (SDEA) was asked for its position on the submission of this waiver request.  In September 2009, SDEA indicated that it did not support the waiver.  Thus, the waiver was submitted to and approved by the Board of Education on September 29, 2009, without bargaining unit support.</font><p><font size="4">On October 8, 2009, SDEA indicated that it had changed its position and was in support of the waiver.  The waiver has been revised to show bargaining unit support and is re-submitted to the Board of Education for approval. Upon board approval, it will be submited to the California Department of Education for review at its next regularly scheduled meeting.</font><p><font size="4">[Originator/Contact:  Grenita Lathan, Interim Deputy Superintendent, 619.725.7104, glathan@sandi.net]</font><p><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B65L0C4B82/$FILE/QEIA%20Waiver-Roosevelt.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B65L0C4B82/Body/0.C28?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="139" height="47" alt="QEIA Waiver-Roosevelt.pdf" border="0"></a></div>

The goals align with those in the Office of Dropout Prevention and in the ones established in the 2007, report on special education prepared by Dr. Thomas Hehir.  It addresses Response to Intervention (RTI) for both academics and behavior by providing a tiered, problem solving structure for schools. This is supported by research indicating behavior issues as one of the main reasons &quot;at risk&quot; students drop out.</font><p><font size="4">On November 18, 2008, the Board of Education approved a Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) Pilot Proposal for 15 volunteer Title I schools. The purpose of the program is to assist schools in addressing issues relating to discipline, school climate, and student behaviors. The expected results are lower suspension rates, more safe and secure campuses, and fewer distractions from instructional time. </font><p><font size="4">The program includes guiding school teams in setting high school-wide behavioral expectations, lesson plans for teaching behavioral expectations to all students, a continuum of consequences for violating behavioral expectations, school wide and classroom reinforcement system for acknowledging appropriate behavior, and a system for reviewing and monitoring the ongoing use of data for decision-making in regards to school procedures and student interventions. In summary, the program is designed to support staff in successfully addressing the behavioral and discipline systems needed for successful learning and social development of students.</font><p><font size="4">The PBIS strategy is not a packaged program, but a behavior-based system approach that assists a school staff, with feedback from students and families, to develop an effective school wide behavioral support and discipline plan.  The school is guided step-by-step in the development of the plan to ensure a common understanding and mutual responsibility regarding behavioral expectations, rules, positive reinforcement, and consequences. Schools must volunteer to be a part of the program.</font><p><font size="4">The following schools listed below have implemented PBIS at their sites: </font><p><font size="4">Cohort 1 - (began January 2009); Audubon, Carver, Chollas/Mead, Gage, Horton, Johnson, Porter, Valencia Park, and Washington elementary schools; Bell, Correia, Innovation, Memorial Prep, Roosevelt, and Standley middle schools.</font><p><font size="4">Cohort 2 - (began October 2009); Burbank, Carson, Emerson/Bandini, Euclid, Freese, Fulton, Ibarra, Marshall, Perkins, Tierrasanta, and Whitman elementary schools; Challenger, Millennial Tech, Taft middle schools; and Whittier, Riley atypical sites.  </font><p><font size="4">Cohort 3 - (March 2010); </font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Alcott, Baker, Bethune, Grant, Hancock, Jerabek, Knox, McKinley, Nye, Ross, and Walker elementary schools; Clark, Marshall, Montgomery, Wangenheim, and Wilson middle schools</font><font size="4">.</font><font size="4"> </font><p><font size="4">[Originator/Contact: Nellie Meyer, Executive Director, Dropout Prevention Office, Office of the Deputy Superintendent, 619.725.7388, </font><a href="mailto:nmeyer@sandi.net"><u><font size="4" color="#0000FF">nmeyer@sandi.net</font></u></a><font size="4">]</font><p><font size="4"> </font><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6790C5009/$FILE/safe%20&amp;%20civil.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6790C5009/Body/0.1188?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="76" height="47" alt="safe &amp; civil.pdf" border="0"></a></div>

This Second Amendment ends the requirement that the district pay the university for additional training for intern candidates above and beyond the program requirements, as state funding for this purpose is no longer provided to the district. </span></span></p>

On June 23, 2009, the board approved a First Amendment to the Agreement reflecting a reduced rate to be paid to the university for interns participating in the program during the 2008-09 school year due to a reduction of the district&#39;s 2008-09 state intern grant.</span></span></p>

The term of the Agreement is from March 1, 2010 to February 28, 2012. <br></font><b><font size="4"><br>FISCAL IMPACT:</font></b><font size="4">  Public Contract Code section 20111 requires a school district to competitively bid non-construction services not to exceed 76,700 for the calendar year 2009. Seven bids for these services were received on December 11, 2009, ranging from $357,143.50 to $583,728.75, providing fixed costs for two years of services.

The quantities and line items of the bid were writtten after re-evaluation of the services provided by previous contracts. The quantities in the bid were also adjusted based on the projected volume of construction projects expected to bid and awarded within the two-year term of this Agreement. Prices will be held firm during the two-year term of this Agreement, ending on February 28, 2012. In addition, the district has added on-line plan room services to this Agreement in an effort to reach out to more contractors doing business in the San Diego area, thereby increasing competition for the district's business on future construction projects. <br><br>The district has performed a price comparison of major line items in this Agreement with prices in the previous agreement and determined that there is a cost savings of approximately 37 percent in this new Agreement. </font><p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">[Originator/Contact: Chuck Brown, Director, Facilities Planning and Construction, Office of the Executive Director, 2008 Capital Improvements Bond Program, 858.637.3686, </font><a href="mailto:cbrown1@sandi.net"><u><font size="4" color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman">cbrown1@sandi.net</font></u></a><u><font size="4" color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman">]</font></u><p><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B68G0C52A0/$FILE/CS-90-653-29%20Bid%20Agreement.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B68G0C52A0/Body/0.C4A?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="163" height="47" alt="CS-90-653-29 Bid Agreement.pdf" border="0"></a></div>
