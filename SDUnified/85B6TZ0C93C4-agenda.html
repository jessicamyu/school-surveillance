In accordance with state law, the district established an Independent Citizens Oversight Committee (ICOC) to review and report to the public on the proper expenditure of taxpayers' money for work performed using Proposition S funds, and to advise the public as to whether the district is in compliance with state law in the use of Proposition S funds. On October 13, 2009, the board approved the Bylaws of the ICOC.  In order to fulfill its requirements to the public, the ICOC desires for the district to employ a firm to assist in the conduct of its work. Some of the tasks required by the ICOC include: (1) assistance with preparation of financial and independent performance audits, (2) site reviews of Prop S construction projects in progress, and (3) annual reports on the Prop S Business Outreach Program, Labor Compliance Program, and joint use facilities projects and property acquisitions financed by Prop S.  (Education Code section 15278 et. seq.)</font><p><font size="4">Education Code section 15280 states that the governing board of a school district shall, without expending bond funds, provide the ICOC with any necessary technical assistance and administrative assistance in furtherance of its purpose and sufficient resources to publicize the conclusions of the ICOC. </font><p><font size="4">Government Code section 53060 allows a school district to contract with and employ any persons for the furnishing of special services if such persons are specially trained, experienced and competent to perform the special services required. <br><br>Although not required to do so, the district advertised Request for Proposals (RFP) No. PS-90-520-02 on September 21, 2009, seeking competitive proposals from interested firms to ensure best value and maximize competition.

The panel will work together with district staff, the ACUESP and ultimately the board to evaluate the potential for reconstruction and redevelopment of the EBEC and evaluate the highest and best use the school district's real property assets in order to accomplish the task. The ULI panel will define the requirements for future usage of the property, which will include a discussion of the potential financing options to move forward with the project.</font><font size="4"><br></font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>The district has 28 properties that have been declared excess, which are not currently used as active district school sites. On September 24, the ACUESP approved a motion for district staff to take the application forward for board review and approval. The ACUESP has categorized and made recommendations for the use of the 28 properties to the board. The EBEC is one of the excess locations. The EBEC is the primary administrative head quarters of the district and is the site most immediately interesting to the district. The site is comprised of 20 buildings with approximately 172,868 square feet on 11.43 acres. </font><p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The district is interested in redeveloping the 50 plus year old, deteriorating building and adjacent temporary buildings that have outlived their useful lives. Several studies have been completed for the redevelopment of the building but none of these have been implemented. The EBEC currently is the district&#8217;s main office location, with many administrative programs housed in the facility. The district needs an appropriate facility to house these services and potentially others while supporting the district for another 50 plus years. ULI will only review and recommend the other 27 sites as appropriate to accomplish the task.</font><font size="4"><br></font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>Approval of this agenda item will authorize the Executive Director, Auxiliary Services, or his designee, to execute any documents in connection therewith.</font><font size="4"><br></font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>[Originator/Contact: Drew Rowlands, Executive Director, Auxiliary Services, Office of the Chief Financial Officer, 858.637.6242, </font><a href="mailto:gbecker@sandi.net"><u><font size="4" color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman">drowlands@sandi.net</font></u></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">]</font><font size="4"> </font><p><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6WC0C96FD/$FILE/ULI%20Technical%20Assistance%20Application%20Cover.doc.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6WC0C96FD/Body/0.D8A?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="254" height="47" alt="ULI Technical Assistance Application Cover.doc.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6WC0C96FD/$FILE/ULI%20Technical%20Assistance%20Application%20Assignment%20Supplement%20Background.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6WC0C96FD/Body/0.1B56?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="379" height="47" alt="ULI Technical Assistance Application Assignment Supplement Background.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6WC0C96FD/$FILE/EDUCATION%20CENTER.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6WC0C96FD/Body/0.2C36?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="136" height="47" alt="EDUCATION CENTER.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6WC0C96FD/$FILE/Real%20Quest%20Report%20and%20County%20Assessors%20Map%20of%20Ed%20Center.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6WC0C96FD/Body/0.3696?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="307" height="47" alt="Real Quest Report and County Assessors Map of Ed Center.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6WC0C96FD/$FILE/Ed%20Center%20Small%20Scale%20Plot%20Plan.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6WC0C96FD/Body/0.454C?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="176" height="47" alt="Ed Center Small Scale Plot Plan.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6WC0C96FD/$FILE/Ed%20Center%20Arial%202007.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6WC0C96FD/Body/0.5034?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="123" height="47" alt="Ed Center Arial 2007.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6WC0C96FD/$FILE/Ed%20Center%20Arials%202000.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6WC0C96FD/Body/0.5A6C?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="128" height="47" alt="Ed Center Arials 2000.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6WC0C96FD/$FILE/PMP%20Site%20Map%20January%202009.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6WC0C96FD/Body/0.6462?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="161" height="47" alt="PMP Site Map January 2009.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6WC0C96FD/$FILE/PMP%20by%20Alpha%20Jan%202009.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6WC0C96FD/Body/0.7298?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="140" height="47" alt="PMP by Alpha Jan 2009.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6WC0C96FD/$FILE/PMP%20FINAL%20W%20COMMENTS%20REVISED%20FOR%202009%20EXHIBIT%20C.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6WC0C96FD/Body/0.80E2?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="318" height="47" alt="PMP FINAL W COMMENTS REVISED FOR 2009 EXHIBIT C.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6WC0C96FD/$FILE/PMP%20with%20As%20Of%20Date%20Column%202009.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6WC0C96FD/Body/0.93A6?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="191" height="47" alt="PMP with As Of Date Column 2009.pdf" border="0"></a></div>

<div class="itembody"><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">RECOMMENDATION:</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">  Approve agreement with WestEd to provide a comprehensive professional development Quality Teaching for English Learners (QTEL) apprenticeship process that will enhance district capacity to design, implement, and support quality instruction for secondary-level English learners. Services delivered will provide QTEL professional development for approximately 240 district teachers as well as develop QTEL certified district teacher leaders. Agreement is effective December 1, 2009, through December 31, 2011.</font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">FISCAL IMPACT:</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">  The total amount of this Agreement with WestEd is $650,000, to be paid from Title III funds, which must be used to support English learners, and will be allocated proportionally over three fiscal years: 2009-10 ($210,000); 2010-11 ($210,000); and 2011-12 ($230,000). Title III funds must be spent to prevent delay of subsequent funds. Significant future costs savings will be realized as a result of shifting responsibilities from QTEL consultants to QTEL certified district staff.</font><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">IMPACT TO DISTRICT STAFFING: </font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">None.</font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">BACKGROUND:</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">  The district has identified a need to improve achievement of English learners (ELs).  The district is now in program improvement, in part due to the achievement levels of our EL students. At the secondary level in particular, a key area of need is in building teacher capacity to provide effective instruction across all content areas for ELs. </font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Of the nearly 32,000 current ELs enrolled in district schools, approximately 10,000&#8211;or almost one-third&#8211;are enrolled in Grades 6-12 at the middle and senior high schools.  This is a very diverse group representing students at all levels of English language proficiency and academic preparation.  Most ELs who began school in the primary grades have made timely progress in learning English and were reclassified in the elementary years.  However, the majority (approaching 70 percent) of students currently identified as ELs at the secondary level are considered &#8220;long term&#8221; ELs who have attended school for seven or more years.  While fluent in English, many of these students lack the academic skills, as measured on California Standards Tests (CST), needed to be reclassified as Reclassified Fluent English Proficient (RFEP). Conversely, fewer than 5 percent of secondary EL students are 'New Arrivals' &#8211; students who are new to the United States and new to English.  The remaining secondary EL students are those who arrived in the U.S. at the secondary level and are in the process of developing English proficiency.</font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Effectively teaching this diverse group of secondary ELs is a challenge.  Teachers need support in meeting this challenge.  Currently, there is district staff that holds expertise in aspects of effective instruction for ELs.  The district does not, however, have sufficient capacity to provide the breadth and depth of professional development that is required.  There is a need to develop an intensive, comprehensive professional development plan that will develop district capacity in providing effective instruction to English learners, and all students.  QTEL&#8217;s apprenticeship process for professional development and capacity building is designed to meet this need. </font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">QTEL is a research-based, proven process that has already shown promise in the district.  Since fall of 2007, QTEL staff has provided ten QTEL institutes to cohorts of district middle and senior high teachers as well as intensive QTEL institutes and on-site support for English language arts teachers at eight middle schools.  Evaluations have been overwhelmingly positive by both teachers and principals in promoting changes in instructional practice which promotes achievement of all students.  Teachers note that through QTEL, they develop the approaches and strategies they need to be more effective in their work.  The Office of Language Acquisition regularly receives calls from teachers and principals requesting QTEL professional development.  The QTEL apprenticeship process has also been successfully implemented in other large, urban school districts including New York City (winner of the Broad Prize in 2007) and Austin, Texas.  Both of these districts credit QTEL as a key factor in improved student achievement. </font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">This agreement establishes a three-year collaboration with WestEd&#8217;s QTEL staff to provide an apprenticeship process that will provide training for principals, involve approximately 240 secondary teachers in QTEL professional development, and will result in a cadre of district teachers who are QTEL certified to provide professional development and on-site teacher support.  This district teacher cadre will continue to provide professional development and site-based instructional support for district staff, using the resources and supports of QTEL. This professional development will begin with secondary teachers and expand into the upper elementary grades. </font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The apprenticeship process will be implemented in three phases, over a 24-month period.  Phase one begins in December 2009, with a full-day principal conference with Aida Walqui (requested by the Secondary School Improvement Officers), director of QTEL and a nationally recognized expert on issues related to adolescent English learners.  Professional development institutes will begin in January 2010, and continue through December 2011.  Intensive institutes will be scheduled during the summer months. Teachers will be compensated for their time during summer institutes or other non-contract hours. Staff met with middle and senior high school principals who support the QTEL professional development plan.</font><br><font size="1" face="Times New Roman"> </font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The QTEL apprenticeship process will be a coordinated effort, implemented with cross-district collaboration and support.

This item will add an additional $1,500,000.00 to the previously-approved amounts of $3,600,000.00 on June 23, 2009, item. I.077.; and $1,400,000.00 on September 8, 2009, item I.25., for nonpublic school service provider agreements for the term July 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009. Approval of this spending authorization will not exceed the budgeted NPS amount of $12.73 million for the entire 2009-10 fiscal year. Cost is not to exceed $6,500,000.00 for the term, and will be funded from Special Education Program funds: 5389-65000-00-5110/5174-1180-5750-01000-4699.</font><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">IMPACT TO DISTRICT</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">:  There is no impact to district staffing; services are provided by outside vendors. </font><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">BACKGROUND</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">: The number of nonpublic school providers has increased from 26 schools in June 2009, to 34 schools requiring expenditure of additional funds from the budgeted amount for the 2009-10 fiscal year. These additional providers either were not certified or students had not been identified for placement in time for inclusion of these agreements on the June 23, 2009 agenda.</font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Nonpublic schools provide educational services for students, as mandated by their Individual Education Program (IEP) and state and federal special education laws, who have not been successful in standard classroom environments. Students may exhibit disabilities such as autism or other developmental and/or physical disabilities, psychological, emotional and/or behavioral disturbance; or may require a residential treatment environment. The nonpublic programs include a variety of support services including vocational services, individual, group and family counseling. Instruction is provided in individual and/or small group settings. </font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Nonpublic school placement is dictated by IEP mandate, due process or mediation agreements, or nonpublic school (NPS) students moving into SDUSD boundaries. In addition, students may be placed in an NPS by County Mental Health or other County agencies requiring the district to assume SpEd student educational costs. Therefore, student enrollment count can change or new nonpublic schools may be identified at any time during the year. In addition, students may be placed prior to board approval which often requires ratification of NPS agreements. </font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Because the California Dept of Education (CDE) issues nonpublic school (NPS) certification documents by the calendar year (January through December) rather than a school or fiscal year (July through June) resulting in a district decision in 2005 to approve nonpublic school contracts only through the end date of the CDE certification document, NPS contracts are submitted for board approval twice yearly. Therefore, the term of these agreements begin on July 1, 2009 and end on December 30, 2009.</font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">[Originator/Contact: Susan Martinez, Executive Director, Special Education Programs, Office of the Chief Student Services Officer, 619.725.7650, </font><a href="mailto:smartinez7@sandi.net"><u><font size="4" color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman">smartinez7@sandi.net</font></u></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">]</font><br><br><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6XV0C99BF/$FILE/Nonpublic%20School%20Providers.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6XV0C99BF/Body/0.1274?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="157" height="47" alt="Nonpublic School Providers.pdf" border="0"></a></div>

This represents an increase of </font><s><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">5.9 </font></s><b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> 6.9</font></i></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">new FTEs within the Mental Health Resource Center.  Qualified district staff will have the opportunity to apply for these positions.</font><br><br><b><font size="4">BACKGROUND:</font></b><font size="4"> The Mental Health Resource Center (MHRC) was awarded a contract through County of San Diego, Health and Human Services Agency to develop a school-based suicide prevention and early intervention program to serve children, youth, and transition-aged youth (TAY) in school settings, including middle and high school aged youth. The services shall include three components: 1) a multi-level suicide prevention program implemented through the public health approach, 2) an evidence-based practice that focuses on reducing risk and enhancing proactive factors for youth in Grades 7-12, and 3) a comprehensive and collaborative approach to suicide prevention for at-risk middle through high school youth that clearly describes support services and necessary linkages. <br><br>Prevention and early intervention (PEI) is one of five program components of the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) that target those community members that do not meet criteria for receiving mental health services. PEI priority populations include children and youth who are: in stressed families; at risk for school failure; at risk of or experiencing juvenile justice involvement; and underserved cultural populations.</font><br><font size="4"><br>San Diego is a &#8220;System of Care&#8221; county. The System of Care is based on Child and Adolescent Service Program (CASSP) System of Care principles, and the Wraparound Initiative of the State of California (SB163). System of Care values are evidenced by: flexibility and responsiveness to the diverse populations served; cultural competence and sensitivity; provision of client-centered, family-focused services; participation in the development of a regional system of care that is accessible and outcome driven; community-based approach that provides maximum linkage to local community resources; multi-disciplinary and strength-based approach; and MHSA to provide culturally specific services as a priority.<br></font><br><font size="4">The program budgets are attached as Exhibit C of the contract.<br></font><b><font size="4"><br>Goals</font></b><font size="4"><br>The overarching goal of the PEI is to expand the behavioral health system of care to include prevention and early intervention in addition to existing treatment services. PEI allows for a broader section of students to benefit from preventative public mental health services provided in the school setting.<br></font><br><font size="4">The MHRC, in collaboration with the Union of Pan Asian Communities (UPAC) and Yellow Ribbon, an evidence based suicide prevention program, will develop strategies that will encourage at-risk students to seek help and to follow through on referrals to mental health services through an ongoing effort of outreach, training, and education of students, school staff, and families. Other components include reducing risk factors and enhancing protective factors, including reducing stigma around seeking help and promoting education about mental health.<br></font><br><font size="4">This program will provide education and/or training for students, families, school staff and peers about the warning signs and risk factors of depression and suicide, as well as protective factors that reduce the likelihood of suicide. Helping students feel connected to their school, which has proven to be the number one protective factor against suicidal behavior, will be a priority.</font><br><font size="4"> </font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>[Originator/Contact: Shirley Culver, Program Manager, Mental Health Resource Center, Office of the Chief Student Services Officer, 858.573.2227, sculver@sandi.net]</font><br><br><font size="4"> </font><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6YF0C9B60/$FILE/Contract%20531488_Suicide%20Prevention.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6YF0C9B60/Body/0.13F8?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="196" height="47" alt="contract 531488_suicide prevention.pdf" border="0"></a></div>

This action further reduced the cost of office and classroom supplies by utilizing an agreement having an aggregate purchasing volume by schools and governmental agencies nationwide in excess of $500,000,000 annually. In addition, the County of Los Angeles agreement provides the district with better rebates and cost reductions than the district could obtain if it completed its own bid for these goods.  For example, this contract provides the district with an additional 3 percent discount based upon the district meeting the $3,500,000 threshold for annual purchases and Office Depot only offers this additional discount on this nationwide contract.  The district utilizes this discount to further reduce the cost of frequently purchased items for schools, such as copier paper, classroom composition books, crayons, markers, and pencils.  Office Depot also provides the district&#8217;s contract pricing to its teachers and other staff for their personal use when purchasing at Office Depot retail stores</font><p><font size="4">The Office Depot Foundation has also supported the district&#8217;s Everybody Recommitting to Academic Achievement Conference (ERAA) event with the donation of backpacks for students, and it donated materials for use by students evacuated to Qualcomm Stadium during the 2007 wildfires.  Office Depot has also simplified the district&#8217;s ordering of office and classroom supplies by utilizing the functionality within the PeopleSoft eProcurement system.  During FY 2008-09, there were over 80,000 lines of orders electronically placed by schools and departments.  98.88 percent of the lines ordered were shipped the next day to schools and departments, and the balance of these orders were shipped within an average of eight days after the order was placed.  In addition, every line ordered is budget checked to ensure that funds are available and encumbered against district budgets at the time of order.</font><br><br><font size="4">Under Public Contract Code section 20118, the governing board has determined that it is in the best interests of the district to utilize this &quot;piggyback&quot; contract to purchase office and classroom supplies.

The total value of payments from January 1, 2009 through October 22, 2009 is $283,970.97.</font><br><br><b><font size="4">IMPACT TO DISTRICT STAFFING: </font></b><font size="4">None.</font><font size="4"><br></font><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>BACKGROUND: </font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The district has standardized its classroom furniture for many years to be the Virco classroom product lines.  Virco manufactures a durable classroom product at a reasonable cost that lasts for many years.  By using the Wichita Unified School District's agreement with Virco as a strategically sourced contract, the district further reduces its cost for classroom furniture by leveraging its purchases as part of a $100,000,000 nationwide contract used by other school districts and governmental agencies.  This agreement provides the lowest cost, net to buyer, that Virco will sell its products.  In addition,  only this Virco agreement has various delivery options and increasing discounts for larger orders that the district uses to its advantage to further reduce costs.  Virco's manufacturing facility is in Torrance, CA, which benefits the district by providing expedited delivery of classroom furniture directly from the manufacturer.</font><p><font size="4">Under Public Contract Code section 20118, the governing board has determined that it is in the best interests of the district to utilize this &quot;piggyback&quot; contract to purchase office and classroom supplies. That statute provides that the district may purchase personal property from contracts already competitively bid by another public agency. The district may only order products specified in the contract at the prices specified in the contract.</font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>[Originator/Contact; Arthur Hanby, Strategic Sourcing and Contracts Officer, Office of the Chief Financial Officer, 858.588.5808, </font><a href="mailto:ahanby@sandi.net"><u><font size="4" color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman">ahanby@sandi.net</font></u></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> ]</font><font size="4"> </font><br><br><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6ZR0CA05B/$FILE/Education%20Furniture%20BOE%20AUGUST%2011-2008.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6ZR0CA05B/Body/0.A92?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="233" height="47" alt="Education Furniture BOE AUGUST 11-2008.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6ZR0CA05B/$FILE/US%20COMMUNITIES%20ADMINISTRATION%20AGREEMENT%20WITH%20USD%20259%20AND%20VIRCO.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6ZR0CA05B/Body/0.17CA?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="428" height="47" alt="US COMMUNITIES ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT WITH USD 259 AND VIRCO.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6ZR0CA05B/$FILE/Virco%20Award%20Notice%20Education%20Furniture%20RFP%2008%2044%20685%2008%2012%202008.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6ZR0CA05B/Body/0.2ACE?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="344" height="47" alt="Virco Award Notice Education Furniture RFP 08 44 685 08 12 2008.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6ZR0CA05B/$FILE/WPS%20COMPANY%20AGREEMENT%20WITH%20VIRCO.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B6ZR0CA05B/Body/0.3AFA?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="246" height="47" alt="WPS COMPANY AGREEMENT WITH VIRCO.pdf" border="0"></a></div>

An extension will generate future lease income and continue the current revenue stream for the district. The non-restricted income generated by the site currently is approximately $220,100.00 annually. Loss of this income would negatively impact the district. Future income from the lease will increase according to scheduled rent increases. Further, as consideration for the extension, Vista Hill Foundation offers financial incentives and capital improvements to the site.</font><font size="4"><br></font><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>IMPACT TO DISTRICT STAFFING:</font></b><font size="4"> None.<br></font><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>BACKGROUND: </font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">On May 10, 1988, the board approved a Lease with Vista Hill Foundation (Lessee) for a portion of the former Grantville Elementary School site, from September 6, 1988, through September 30, 2013. In Closed Session on October 13, 2009, the board approved the commencement of negotiations with Lessee for extension of the Lease within the following parameters:</font><ul type="disc"><li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Extend the term to 25 years.</font><font size="4"> </font><li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Negotiate financial terms to benefit the district, including, at a minimum, payment of district&#8217;s legal fees for the lease amendment.</font><font size="4"> </font><li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Negotiate other revisions to the lease terms for the benefit of the district.</font></ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>The negotiations are complete. An Amended and Restated Lease is necessary in order for the district to obtain a one-time payment of $5,000 for legal fees and extend the expiration date to September 30, 2038. All other terms and conditions of the Lease will remain in full force and effect.</font><p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">District staff has determined it is highly unlikely the former Grantville school site will be needed for classroom space in the near future. Currently, both the demographer and the district&#8217;s Long Range Facilities Master Plan indicate that overall enrollment in the district and in the Grantville area will either remain static or continue to decline. Regardless of the length of any extension term granted, in the event the district did need the site, the district has incorporated an early termination clause in the lease which allows the district to take back the property if needed.

Students who have earned ASE certification and participated in AYES programs are in high demand with employers. The modernization of the existing 600 building and the construction of an additional 7,000 square foot building which will contain auto work bays, a paint room, classrooms and offices will enable the program to obtain NATEF certification.</font><p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">[Originator/Contact: Chuck Brown, Director, Facilities Planning and Construction, Office of the Executive Director, 2008 Capital Improvements Bond Program, 858.637.3686, </font><a href="mailto:cbrown1@sandi.net"></a><a href="mailto:cbrown1@sandi.net"><u><font size="4" color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman">cbrown1@sandi.net</font></u></a><a href="mailto:cbrown1@sandi.net"></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> ]</font><p><font size="4" face="Arial"> </font><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B7220CA173/$FILE/CS-90-384-57%20Bid%20Agreement.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B7220CA173/Body/0.FB0?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="163" height="47" alt="CS-90-384-57 Bid Agreement.pdf" border="0"></a></div>

This product requires a four-step installation and finishing process by specialized technicians.<br><br>The majority of work which will be performed using this contract will be a direct result of repair or construction work performed by in-house forces. The need for repairs to the terrazzo results from building foundations settling, facility remodeling projects, or major repair and replacement jobs performed by the district. <br><br>District employees have collaborated with terrazzo contractors to develop a very high grade finished product that requires less attention from custodial staff (no more waxing and easier vandalism clean up),and it also looks much better than the traditional wax finish that has been used for years. This collaboration has had a direct and positive effect on the amount of custodial labor hours required to clean and maintain terrazzo surfaces. </font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">[Originator/Contact: Drew Rowlands, Executive Director, Auxiliary Services, Office of the Chief Financial Officer, 858.627.7121, </font><a href="mailto:wrowlands@sandi.net"><u><font size="4" color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman">wrowlands@sandi.net</font></u></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">]</font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font><br><br><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B7280CA2AB/$FILE/CC-90-459-29%20Bid%20Agreement.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B7280CA2AB/Body/0.A8A?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="163" height="47" alt="CC-90-459-29 Bid Agreement.pdf" border="0"></a></div>

Sillman,Wright Architects, Inc. commenced design work for this school on June 9, 2005 pursuant to contract C-7240; however, this contract terminated on May 31, 2009, and additional services by this firm are necessary to complete the project. Pursuant to Division of the State Architect (DSA) requirements, an architect assigned to a particular project must complete the design services for that project. While a different architect could be retained in special instances, a change of the architect greatly complicates the process since (1) DSA approval would be considerably delayed, and, (2) there is a liability issue since the initial architect is relieved from liability for work performed by a different firm. Further, there is a timing issue since the district needs to receive all the required DSA approvals by the end of the 2009-2010 fiscal year in order to meet the construction schedule for school completion. </font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br><br>California Government Code section 4525, et seq., grants the district the authority to contract with and employ persons for the furnishing of engineering and environmental services if such persons are specially trained, experienced, and competent to perform the special services requested. <br><br>[Originator/Contact: Chuck Brown, Director, Facilities Planning and Construction, Office of the Executive Director, Capital Improvement Bond Program, </font><a href="mailto:cbrown1@sandi.net"><u><font size="4" color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman">cbrown1@sandi.net</font></u></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> at 858.637.3686]</font><font size="4"><br></font><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B72B0CA2BE/$FILE/PS-90-591-02%20Agreement.Sillman%20Wright.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B72B0CA2BE/Body/0.984?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="215" height="47" alt="PS-90-591-02 Agreement.Sillman Wright.pdf" border="0"></a></div>

<div class="itembody"><p><b><font size="4">RECOMMENDATION</font></b><font size="4">: Ratification of the Revised Notices To Proceed (NTP) 1R1 to Logical Choice Technologies, Inc. (Agreement PS-89-220-02) and Vector Resources, Inc. (Agreement PS-89-334-02) for i21 Interactive Classroom Packages. The revisions are the result of: 1) operational requirements; 2) number of interactive white boards have been amended at certain schools sites; and 3) cost has been modified to reflect site conditions and number of boards required per school site. Also, ratification of NTP 3 to Logical Choice Technologies and NTP 2 to Vector Resources relate to classroom training services. The First Amendment with each of the vendors provides that all NTP&rsquo;s issued against the work authorized by the district are ratified or approved by the board as the work proceeds. </font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="4">FISCAL IMPACT</font></b><font size="4">: The contracts are on an &ldquo;as required&rdquo; basis for a term of one year with an option to extend two years at district&rsquo;s election. Each contract utilizes the California Multiple Award Schedule (CMAS) from the California Department of General Services as the primary contracting vehicle for efficiency and cost, and does not exceed $25 million (Proposition S funds). No additional funding is required. This revised NTP 1R1 for Logical Choice states the total not to exceed as $5,474,247.60 compared to the estimated not to exceed amount of $6,144,905.34 in the original NTP, and represents a savings of $670,657.70 to the district. This revised NTP 1R1 for Vector Resources states the total not to exceed as $6,751,814.40 compared to the estimated not to exceed amount of $7,357,665.08 in the original NTP, and represents a savings of $605,850.68 to the district.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="4">IMPACT TO DISTRICT STAFFING:</font></b><font size="4"> None.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="4">BACKGROUND</font></b><font size="4">: The i21 Interactive Classroom Packages is a state of the art system that provides for an interconnected learning environment that integrates mobile computing as well as audio, visual, and formative assessment technologies. At the June 2, 2009 public meeting, the board approved a five year plan for this project at all district sites. The above original Agreements with each of the vendors cover work for the first year of the five-year plan.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="4">Under Public Contract Code section 10299, a school district may, without further competitive bidding, use CMAS contracts for the acquisition of information technology, goods, and services. At the June 23, 2009 public meeting, the board approved Agreements with Logical Choice Technologies and Vector Resources relating to the furnish and installation of Promethean boards as part of the i21 Interactive Classroom packages at all district school sites pursuant to Proposition S. The board approval allowed the district to procure Promethean interactive whiteboards and installation under the specified CMAS contracts that Logical Choice Technologies and Vector Resources have with the Department of General Services and to directly obtain professional services (such as survey, engineering, and design) from Logical Choice Technologies and Vector Resources. </font><br />
<br />
<font size="4">At the August 4, 2009 public meeting, the board approved the First Amendment and ratification of the NTP 1 and 2 for Logical Choice Technologies and NTP 1 for Vector Resources for the i21 Interactive Classroom Packages. The First Amendment provides that all NTP&rsquo;s issued against the contracts for work authorized by the district are ratified or approved by the board as the work proceeds. In addition, the First Amendment with Vector Resources includes an additional CMAS contract No. 3-08-70-0876Y, to more effectively utilize cost savings to the district in completion of the services provided under the Agreement.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="4">This revised NTP 1R1 for Logical Choice Technologies lists the modified costs at each school to reflect the site conditions and number of boards per school site. This revised NTP 1R1 for Vector Resources lists the modified costs at each school to reflect the site conditions and number of boards per school site</font><br />
<br />
<font size="4">NTP 3 to Logical Choice Technologies and NTP 2 to Vector Resources provides training services to the district on how to use the Promethean boards under the above Agreements for the i21 Interactive Classroom Packages.</font></p>

There will be a combination of cost savings, by not assigning routes to First Student, Inc., and also cost increases by operating these routes as part of the overall home to school bus transportation services provided by the Transportation Services Department.  An analysis of the remainder of the 2009/2010 year shows an approximate net savings of $613,000 and full year net savings in 2010/2011 of approximately $1,004,000. </font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">IMPACT TO DISTRICT STAFFING:  </font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">District staffing will increase to service the bus routes previously operated by First Student.  This includes the hiring of up to 25 new school bus driver positions and up to two mechanic positions.  Some existing school bus drivers will be afforded additional work hours. The costs associated with these changes are included in the fiscal impact statement above.     </font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">BACKGROUND:</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> On June 23, 2009, the board approved an agreement with First Student, Inc. for home-to-school bus services for the term July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2011. The agenda item (H.03.) provided a rationale for the award of the agreement in that the services provided to the district by this agreement was part of a bridge and transition strategy that would provide the district with the time to eventually establish a fully self-sufficient home-to-school bus transportation operation not dependent on contractor support. It would also provide staff with the ability to proceed with a totally in-house bus transportation strategy recommended by The Portolan Group, Inc. Since that approval, the board has approved an increase in the minimum number of students required to support the operation of a bus route (Rule of 15), and the number of students eligible for home-to-school bus transportation has decreased. The combination of these factors now presents the opportunity to terminate this agreement, and for the district to totally provide home-to-school bus transportation services to eligible students. </font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The agreement allows the district to terminate with 30 days written notice to First Student. </font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">[Originator/Originator; Drew Rowlands, Executive Director of Auxiliary Services, Office of the Chief Financial Officer, 858.627.7121, </font><a href="mailto:wrowlands@sandi.net"><u><font size="4" color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman">wrowlands@sandi.net</font></u></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> ]</font></div>
