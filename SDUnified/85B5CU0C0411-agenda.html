<p><b><font size="4">FISCAL IMPACT:</font></b><font size="4"> Total project cost is estimated</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"> at $20,000,000; CCDC Redevelopment Fund 25000</font><font size="4">.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="4">PRIOR YEAR EXPENSE: </font></b><font size="4">None.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="4">IMPACT TO DISTRICT STAFFING: </font></b><font size="4">There is no impact to district staffing levels.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="4">BACKGROUND: </font></b><font size="4">The board workshop will present an overview of the current accomplishments and status of the Prop. S program, and request board direction on two funding issues. A presentation of the Major Repair and Replacement program will also be provided.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="4">Discussion: </font></b><font size="4">Since March 2009, the projected funding available from local bond sales and state facilities matching funds for Prop. S over the next five years has declined by $134 million. This decline is due to the drop in the assessed value of real estate within the district, which reduces the amount of the annual assessment to fund bond interest for Prop. S. The decline is also due to the anticipated reduction in state facilities matching funds. The anticipated funding from state matching funds has declined because fewer projects eligible for matching funds can be awarded due to the lack of local bond revenue, and because the state currently has a backlog of eligible projects that cannot be funded due to the State of California&rsquo;s current fiscal distress. </font><br />
<br />
<font size="4">Thedecline in funding, and the subsequent reprogramming of Prop. S projects, has resulted in the need to delay 94 projects by one to two years. District staff has developed an alternative that would partially mitigate these delays through the use of Centre City Development Corporation (CCDC) redevelopment funds. </font><br />
<br />
<font size="4">CCDC redevelopment funds have been used in recent years to fund improvements at Washington Elementary School that include repainting, site security cameras, as well as additional technology improvements and furniture to support the education programs at the site. An additional $700,000 is now proposed for technology upgrades and furniture at the site in order to create a model technology learning environment.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="4">On June 23, 2009, the Board of Education approved a Letter of Intent (LOI) agreement with the City of San Diego for the placement of a charter school on the sixth and seventh floors in the new downtown library to support downtown educational requirements. The financial terms of the LOI agreement include a 40-year prepaid lease at a cost of $20 million and funding for the lease was identified from Prop. S. The tenant improvements, furniture, equipment and other project costs estimated at $10 million would come from CCDC funds for a total project cost of $30 million. </font><br />
<br />
<font size="4">School district and city staff are currently engaged in finalizing the terms of the lease. The lease needs to be approved by both the Board of Education and the San Diego City Council by May 1, 2010, according to the requirements of the California librarian, to extend a $20 million state matching grant for the project. Construction is scheduled to begin in July 2010. The library and the school are currently scheduled to be completed in July 2013.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="4">Seven million dollars of the $20 million lease payments for the downtown library school could be shifted from Prop. S to CCDC redevelopment funds in the next fiscal year. </font><br />
<br />
<font size="4">An additional $13 million of redevelopment funds could be used for reconstruction projects identified under Prop. S at Roosevelt Middle School, San Diego High School, and other school sites in/adjacent to the redevelopment area as funds become available over the next four to five years. </font><br />
<br />
<font size="4">This action will potentially eliminate the need for seven of the 94 project delays through 2014, and make $20 million in Prop. S funds available for downtown educational facilities projects later in the program.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="4">District staff is also requesting direction on whether early program savings should reside with the school site allocation or be returned to the program.</font><br />

<div class="itembody"><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">RECOMMENDATION:</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> Recommend schools to be included in the 2010-13 Magnet Schools Assistance Program (MSAP) federal grant application.  </font><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>FISCAL IMPACT:</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> None at this time.  The U.S. Department of Education awards three-year MSAP grants of up to $4,000,000 dollars per year for a total of up to $12,000,000 with average awards of approximately $2,500,000 per year. Funding supports the development of the innovative magnet theme, including staff development, supplies, equipment and specific personnel to implement the magnet theme, promote diversity, increase choices in public education programs and turnaround student achievement. Transportation and facilities construction are not allowable uses of MSAP funds.  </font><br><font size="4"> </font><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">PRIOR YEAR EXPENSE HISTORY:</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> San Diego Unified School District received three-year MSAP grants in 1995, 1998, 2001, and 2007 grant cycles. In the current 2007 grant cycle the district will receive, by October 2010, $10,837,237 in restricted allocations.</font><br><font size="4"> </font><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">IMPACT TO DISTRICT STAFFING:</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> The Magnet Schools Assistance Program provides job opportunities for district certificated and classified staff as student enrollment increases at the MSAP-funded schools.  Each MSAP-funded school will require one salaried district position as magnet coordinator.  The magnet coordinator at these sites will be funded by the grant.  Specialized programs may require new staff members at the school site with specific credentials or job skill requirements. The MSAP office requires up to two salaried district central office resource teacher positions to assist schools in grant implementation and one staff member for marketing and recruitment.  These new positions will be funded by the grant, and therefore have an end date following the grant timeline.  </font><br><font size="4"> </font><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">BACKGROUND: </font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The district Magnet Schools office is preparing the grant proposal for the 2010 MSAP, a competitive federal grant that provides support to districts to significantly revise existing or develop new magnet schools to support district integration efforts and close the achievement gap.  </font><br><font size="4"> </font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Selection of recommended schools by the Board of Education is critical to the development of the MSAP federal grant application. School principals have been contacted for initial interest and local needs.  After board recommendations are finalized, each school staff and community will be contacted for interest and the development of the rigorous, innovative program selected by the school. Staff approval will be by anonymous vote and final approval of schools and planned theme/pedagogy will be brought to the board for approval.  </font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The U.S. Department of Education has indicated that they expect to open the 2010 application package for the MSAP grant on March 12, 2010, with Local Educational Agencies (LEA) applications due on April 26, 2010.  Grants awarded in this competition will begin with the 2010-11 school year.  In order to meet the application deadline it is imperative to develop school plans with staff and communities.  </font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Schools recommended were selected by staff including Chief Improvement Officers, School Improvement Officers, Enrollment Options, Instructional Facilitated Planning, Language Acquisition and Magnet Schools.  These recommendations assist in building a cohesive magnet schools theme program through high school cluster patterns (Attachment 1, MSAP Recommendations to the Board). Recommendations in </font><b><font size="4" color="#C00000" face="Times New Roman">red ink</font></b><font size="4" color="#C00000" face="Times New Roman"> </font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">are staff top choices; recommendations listed in </font><b><font size="4" color="#002060" face="Times New Roman">blue ink</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> are additional recommendations for board consideration. The district may request up to $4 million per year, therefore, specific choices must tally not more than $4 million per year.  </font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Grant Goals:</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">  This grant provides the initial funds necessary to develop inventive, exciting educational programs that attract students from all racial and socio-economic backgrounds to attend.  There are six specific goals associated with this federal grant: Integration, Student Academic Success, Magnet Theme/Innovation, Real-World 21st Century Skills, Sustainability, and Academic Equitable Access.  </font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">MSAP Grant Additional Priority Points:</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">  There are two sets of priority points assigned to this grant.  1) Priority points are awarded for including schools in Program Improvement, schools that are racially isolated and/or schools that have a high level of financial need (FRL), and schools that have new leadership (0-2 years at the school).  2) Priority points are also awarded to LEA&#8217;s that have sustained MSAP-funded magnet schools from previous grant cycles.  (2001-04 Oak Park, Creative Performing &amp; Media Arts (CPMA), Mission Bay HS, and Webster) (2007-10 Barnard, Birney, Johnson, Joyner, Millennial Tech Middle, Muir)</font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Community Engagement</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">: The MSAP grant requires extensive school site and community commitment.

Once approved to move forward, the project schools</font><font size="4" color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman">&#8217;</font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> staff, governance teams and community partnerships will produce a focused and cohesive three-year MSAP project.  The district will be contacting local, state, and federal representatives to solicit their written support for the district&#8217;s application. Letters of community and legislative support will be included with the grant proposal.</font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Background for Selection of Recommended Schools: </font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">San Diego Unified School District&#8217;s network of magnet schools has been the cornerstone of the district&#8217;s voluntary integration program. The school district has periodically evaluated the magnet program and, when indicated, closes, refocuses or modifies magnet programs and/or adds new magnet programs to improve effectiveness in attaining and maintaining district racial-ethnic balance, socio-economic balance and high student achievement outcomes (Attachment 2, Magnet Continuity by High School Cluster). </font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In 2006, three schools were identified for magnet program closure over a three year period (Chollas Mead, Knox, Fulton); in 2008 an additional school (Grant) was added to the list following district evaluation criteria.  The 2008-09 Magnet Schools of America evaluation of district magnet schools identified the need for a significant revision to develop stronger continuity links between elementary, middle and high school programs. In December 2009, the Board of Education requested a new evaluation of Magnet Schools for the 2009-10 school year (Attachment 3, Preliminary SDUSD Magnet Schools Evaluation, 2009-10).  </font><br><font size="4"> </font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The 2006 district parent survey and the Center City Development Corporation (CCDC) 2009 county-wide parent survey by Competitive Edge Research and Communication were referenced in theme and pedagogy recommendations.  Both surveys indicated student achievement as one of the most important criteria in school selection by parents.  The most popular theme requested on both the 2006 and 2009 surveys was Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) incorporating 21st century integrated technology.</font><br><font size="4"> </font><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">District transportation costs will be kept to a minimum. Some costs will be associated with targeted recruitment to ensure equity and access to the programs.  As part of the district&#8217;s current rigorous evaluation of its magnet schools, analysis of access to programs will be studied and replicated as recommended.  </font><br><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font></b><p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">[Originator/Contact: Carolyn Goohs, Director, Magnet Schools, Office of the Deputy Superintendent, 619.725.7158, cgoohs@sandi.net]</font><p><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5DA0C0837/$FILE/Attach%201%20-%20MSAP%20Recommendations%20to%20the%20Board%20rev2.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5DA0C0837/Body/0.23C2?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="281" height="47" alt="Attach 1 - MSAP Recommendations to the Board rev2.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5DA0C0837/$FILE/Attach%202%20-%20Magnet%20Continuity%20by%20HS%20Clusters.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5DA0C0837/Body/0.3530?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="232" height="47" alt="Attach 2 - Magnet Continuity by HS Clusters.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5DA0C0837/$FILE/Attach%203%20-%20Preliminary%20SDUSD%20Magnet%20Schools%20Evaluation,%202009-10.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5DA0C0837/Body/0.45BE?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="344" height="47" alt="Attach 3 - Preliminary SDUSD Magnet Schools Evaluation, 2009-10.pdf" border="0"></a></div>

Approximately 80 percent of the district&#8217;s unrestricted budget is dedicated to staff (including salary and health and welfare benefit costs).  In order to maintain fiscal solvency, and in conjunction with the March 9 approval of a second interim report, the district must take action to allow for significant reductions in probationary certificated staffing.</font><p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">For probationary certificated employees, Article 19 of the collective bargaining agreement between the district and SDEA allows the board to determine that reductions are necessary due to lack of funds.  Probationary certificated staff potentially-impacted by this action will be served with a contractual layoff notice on or before April 15, 2010.  Noticed employees will be able to challenge the action through the filing of a grievance.  Temporary certificated employees will receive a separate reminder notice that their services will end at the close of the 2009-10 school year.</font><p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In order to provide the necessary flexibility and still meet the contractual notice deadline, which is jurisdictional, this resolution includes an authorization to initiate staff reductions not only for prior actions, plans and projections but also for actions that may occur in the month following this Resolution.  Additionally, based on the fact that staff reductions are typically stated as FTEs rather than a number of part-time and full-time employees, and other factors related to potentially disputed issues regarding seniority and certification, the number of probationary certificated employees receiving notices will exceed the FTE reductions necessary to meet the lack of funds.</font><p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">[Originator/Contact: Sandra Huezo, Chief Human Resources Officer, 619.725.7132, shuezo@sandi.net]</font><font size="4" face="Arial"> </font><p><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5EB0C09D6/$FILE/Certificated%20Layoff%20Resolution%20031610.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5EB0C09D6/Body/0.10CE?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="203" height="47" alt="Certificated Layoff Resolution 031610.pdf" border="0"></a></div>

The Office of Charter Schools recommends the adoption of the staff report as findings in support of the board&#8217;s decision to grant the charter petition. The potential fiscal impact to the district is an estimated loss of $1,400,000 generated in average daily attendance in the first year because the district does not receive any average daily attendance funds for students enrolled at charter schools. SDGVA petitioners submitted their petition for review to the Office of Charter Schools on November 20, 2009. A public hearing for the petition was held on January 19, 2010. The approval of the charter petition shall become effective July 1, 2010, and shall expire on June 30, 2015. <br><br>If the Board of Education desires additional options beyond approval, these options could be: </font><ul type="disc"><li><font size="4">Approve the charter petition with conditions. In essence, the petition is approved with conditions set by the Board of Education. </font><li><font size="4">Deny the charter petition. The Board of Education would need to identify written findings to support a decision to deny the charter renewal. </font></ul><b><font size="4"><br>Charter Petition Review Summary: </font></b><font size="4">The proposed mission of the school is the following, &#8220;To provide every SDGVA student with education that integrates meaningful community service and quality writing instruction to enrich the learning experience, teaching civic responsibility, and strengthen communities.&#8221; Based on a departmental staff and legal review of the original charter petition submitted on November 20, 2009, deficiencies and concerns were identified and district staff met with the charter petitioners to provide feedback and share deficiencies and concerns. Charter petitioners addressed the deficiencies and concerns and submitted modifications to the original charter petition. The approved petition is effective July 1, 2010 and expires on June 30, 2015. <br></font><b><font size="4"><br>Financial Analysis: </font></b><font size="4"><br>The budget and cash flow projection submitted with the charter petition has met the requirement for fiscal information. Based on the projected enrollment, revenue rates and expenses, SDGVA appears to be financially viable. The district will require documentation of sufficient enrollment as has been done for other schools, prior to opening. The school is proposing to open as a Grade K-6 school with a total enrollment of 200 during the first year of operation.<br><br>[Originator/Contact: Tony Burks, Ed.D., Office of Charter Schools,, 619.725.7107, </font><a href="file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/116394/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK13/tburks@sandi.net"><u><font size="4" color="#0000FF">tburks@sandi.net</font></u></a><font size="4">]</font><br><br><font size="4"> </font><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5EE0C0E1C/$FILE/SDGVA%20Final%20Bd%20Report.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5EE0C0E1C/Body/0.E70?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="139" height="47" alt="SDGVA Final Bd Report.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5EE0C0E1C/$FILE/SDGVA%20Charter%20Track%20Change%20Version.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5EE0C0E1C/Body/0.1972?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="209" height="47" alt="SDGVA Charter Track Change Version.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5EE0C0E1C/$FILE/SDGVA%20Charter-%20Clean%20Version.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5EE0C0E1C/Body/0.25D0?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="171" height="47" alt="SDGVA Charter- Clean Version.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5EE0C0E1C/$FILE/SDGVA%20FEEDBACK%202-10-10.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5EE0C0E1C/Body/0.3144?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="161" height="47" alt="SDGVA FEEDBACK 2-10-10.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5EE0C0E1C/$FILE/DistrictFeedbackSummarySDGVA.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5EE0C0E1C/Body/0.3CA4?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="186" height="47" alt="DistrictFeedbackSummarySDGVA.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5EE0C0E1C/$FILE/A%20Founding%20Resumes.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5EE0C0E1C/Body/0.48C8?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="127" height="47" alt="A Founding Resumes.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5EE0C0E1C/$FILE/C%20Curriculum.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5EE0C0E1C/Body/0.52CA?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="85" height="47" alt="C Curriculum.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5EE0C0E1C/$FILE/D%20Board%20By_Laws.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5EE0C0E1C/Body/0.5C18?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="111" height="47" alt="D Board By_Laws.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5EE0C0E1C/$FILE/E%20Conflict%20of%20Interest%20Policies.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5EE0C0E1C/Body/0.65F6?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="160" height="47" alt="E Conflict of Interest Policies.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5EE0C0E1C/$FILE/F%20Resumes%20-%20Board%20Members.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5EE0C0E1C/Body/0.70C4?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="162" height="47" alt="F Resumes -

In collaboration with charter schools, the district Office of Charter Schools developed a template of the Special Education Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to outline the relationship between the district and charter schools for the delivery of Special Education services. McGill has selected Option 1, which means that the school will be considered a public school of the district for the purposes of delivery of special education services and funding.  Under the collaboratively-developed MOU, charter schools will have the following three options for the delivery of Special Education services:</font><ol type="1"><li><font size="4">Charter schools elect to be considered as a public school of the district for the purposes of special education services and funding. The school agrees to pay a local contribution to the district, in return, the district will provide special education services.</font></ol><br><font size="4">2.	Charter Schools are designated as schools within the district Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA). With this option, charter schools may hire their own special education staff, independent of the district, and the district will reimburse the charter school for the actual costs of providing special education services, not to exceed the average annual salary and benefits of the district for equivalent service providers. </font><p><font size="4">3.	Charter schools are designated as schools of another SELPA. This option allows charter schools to join a SELPA other than San Diego Unified. Under this option, the charter schools will meet the requirements of the SELPA under which they will be served. The district retains general oversight responsibilities over the charter schools exercising this option.</font><p><font size="4">[Originator/Contact: Tony Burks, Ed.D., Executive Director, Office of Charter Schools, Secondary School Improvement Office, 619.725.7107, </font><a href="file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/116394/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK13/tburks@sandi.net"><u><font size="4" color="#0000FF">tburks@sandi.net</font></u></a><font size="4">]</font><p><font size="4"> </font><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5EV0C1254/$FILE/McGill%20SPED%20MOU.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B5EV0C1254/Body/0.D96?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="115" height="47" alt="McGill SPED MOU.pdf" border="0"></a></div>
