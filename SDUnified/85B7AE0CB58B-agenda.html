The RFQ was advertised in the </font><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">San Diego Daily Transcript</font></u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">, with DemandStar, a national website, and through the district&#8217;s Facilities Outreach database, Twenty-five proposals were received by the June 30, 2009 district deadline. A five-member evaluation panel consisting of two Senior Facilities Project Managers, the district&#8217;s Controller, a former member of the Independent Citizens Oversight Committee (ICOC), and a senior construction consultant reviewed the proposals based on best value. From this initial paper screening, ten firms were &#8220;short-listed&#8221; for interviews. </font><font size="4"><br></font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>Interviews with the ten firms were held on August 13, 2009. Each firm was allotted one-half hour to answer six questions by a five-member panel. Three questions examined the firm&#8217;s delivery process using a CMMP construction model, and three questions specifically addressed outreach and local participation. The interview panel included two representative from the San Diego County Office of Education, a former district principal, the Executive Director of Auxiliary Services, and a former member of the ICOC. </font><font size="4"><br></font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>The five firms receiving the highest ranking by the interview panel were: (1) Barnhart, Inc.; (2) Gafcon, Inc.; (3) O&#8217;Connor Construction Management, Inc.; (4) Swinerton Management &amp; Consulting, Inc.; and (5) Vanir Construction Management, Inc. All firms have local San Diego offices. </font><br><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">CM Multi-Prime and the District</font></u><font size="4"><br></font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>The five proposed CMMP projects are: (1) Clairemont High School &#8211; New Auto Program Building; (2) Madison High School &#8211; New Multi-Media Building; (3) Hoover High School - Green Construction Program; (4) Morse High School &#8211; New Child Development Center Building; and (5) Madison High School &#8211; Stadium Upgrades (Multiple Projects). The professional services provided by these five firms include development of construction bid packages using the district&#8217;s design documents, assisting district staff to advertise and award the trade contracts, and performing post-award construction management and contract administration. </font><font size="4"><br></font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>Under the CMMP form of construction contracting the owner (the district), in essence, performs the General Contractor role, coordinating multiple contracts with trade-specific firms for overall project execution. The project documents are divided into smaller trade-specific packages and advertised under firm, fixed price sealed bid procedures. Pursuant to California Public Contract Code section 20111, public works construction contracts that are advertised under firm fixed price sealed bidding procedures are awarded to the lowest responsive and qualified bidder.  </font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Under the CMMP method, the construction manager administers, as the district&#8217;s agent, the multiple trade contracts that the district has with the individual trade contractors, also known as &#8220;prime&#8221; contractors.</font><font size="4"><br></font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>One of the key factors reviewed to determine if a prime contractor is qualified to perform public works construction is the payment procedure and performance bonding. Emerging Business Enterprises (EBEs) are often limited in their bonding capacity due to market requirements from construction sureties. Utilizing the CMMP model, larger public works projects are divided into smaller value contracts thereby reducing bonding requirements. This model allows a larger number of trade-specific companies to achieve bonding requirements and, therefore, to be enabled to compete in a sealed bid, firm fixed price bidding procedures. Although it is not a guarantee to that this model will increase EBE participation, it is the expectation that this model will allow for greater opportunities for EBEs to compete for and participate in the district&#8217;s construction program. </font><font size="4"><br></font><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>Proposed Outreach Strategy</font></u><font size="4"><br></font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>As noted above, CMMP allows an excellent opportunity for outreach opportunities to EBEs throughout the bidding process for local and small business participation. CMMP is an important tool that could greatly improve the district&#8217;s ability to meet its outreach objectives. There are two important features of the approach that are of particular significance: 1) the ability to conduct meaningful outreach to qualified subcontractors not typically considered by general contractors, and 2) the opportunity for qualified trade contractors to bid for projects directly as a prime contractor for which they would not otherwise have adequate financial and bonding capacity. The district&#8217;s recently constituted Business Outreach Program staff has been conducting informal meetings with contractors, contractor advocacy organizations and labor unions, seeking feedback on the concept of CMMP. The response to this concept has been overwhelmingly favorable.</font><font size="4"><br></font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>By reducing the size and complexity of bids to more manageable sizes for EBEs, it is anticipated the smaller EBE staffs will be able to submit competitive bids. For each proposed project in lieu of advertising one General Construction contract, it is anticipated that each project will include the advertisement of anywhere from 5 to 12 or more smaller trade-specific jobs (e.g. site work, mechanical/electrical, foundation, steel framing and masonry, landscaping contracts). This process provides multiple opportunities for EBE firms to prepare bids and to compete for projects. </font><font size="4"><br></font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>The FPC Business Outreach Program enthusiastically endorses the CMMP approach. District staff believes that CMMP approach will enhance EBE participation within the overall Prop S program.<br><br>[Originator/Contact: Chuck Brown, Director, Facilities Planning and Construction, Office of the Executive Director, Capital Improvement Bond Program, </font><a href="mailto:cbrown1@sandi.net"><u><font size="4" color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman">cbrown1@sandi.net</font></u></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> at 858.637.3686]</font></div>

Pursuant to board direction provided at a prior meeting, the bylaws contain a specific provision which subjects the members of the ICOC to the provisions of the Political Reform Act, and therefore requires that they submit a Form 700 (Statement of Economic Interests).</font><font size="4"> </font></p>

The APR includes three components: Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) report, Academic Performance Index (API) Growth report, and Program Improvement report.  The AYP report provides data on the achievement of the district and schools with respect to federal No Child Left Behind (NCLB) targets. The API Growth report provides district and school results on 2009 API growth scores and attainment of 2009 state targets. The Program Improvement reports, applicable only to Title I schools and districts, provide information on schools that have not made AYP targets for two or more consecutive years and the federally required interventions. </font><p><font size="4">[Originator/Contact: Ron Rode, Executive Director, Standard Assessment and Accountability, Office of the Deputy Superintendent, 619.725.7190, rrode@sandi.net]<br></font><p><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B7C70CB7DA/$FILE/2009%20APR%20Board%20Briefing,%20Abbreviated.ppt"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B7C70CB7DA/Body/0.922?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="207" height="47" alt="2009 APR Board Briefing, Abbreviated.ppt" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B7C70CB7DA/$FILE/2009%20APR%20Board%20Briefing,%20Abbreviated.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B7C70CB7DA/Body/0.1866?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="207" height="47" alt="2009 APR Board Briefing, Abbreviated.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B7C70CB7DA/$FILE/2009%20APR%20Board%20Briefing.ppt"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B7C70CB7DA/Body/0.2500?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="144" height="47" alt="2009 APR Board Briefing.ppt" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B7C70CB7DA/$FILE/2009%20APR%20Board%20Briefing.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B7C70CB7DA/Body/0.3276?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="144" height="47" alt="2009 APR Board Briefing.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B7C70CB7DA/$FILE/ATT0BBY8/2009%2010-13%20APR%20Board%20Report.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B7C70CB7DA/Body/0.3D06?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="171" height="47" alt="2009 10-13 APR Board Report.pdf" border="0"></a></div>

<p><b><font size="4">FISCAL IMPACT:</font></b><font size="4"> None. </font></p>

<p><b><font size="4">BACKGROUND:</font></b><font size="4"> During the 2008-09 school year, the district was confronted by an unprecedented budget deficit. Various efforts to overcome the financial shortfall included consideration for closure and/or reconfiguration of small elementary schools. This endeavor prompted board discussion about the associated process. Staff has researched the closure/reconfiguration process and herein submits a proposed revision, the result of extensive research of other agencies&#39; practices and consultation with a wide range of district and community stakeholders.</font><br />
<br />
<u><font size="4">Summary of Modifications to the Existing Procedure</font></u></p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li><font size="4">The procedure was expanded to consider not simply closure of a school site, but also reconfiguration to another use. </font></li>
	<li><font size="4">The procedure was reviewed for compliance with existing district policies and board governance policies; some district policies referred to in the current procedure were removed because they did not directly relate to the subject matter of this procedure. </font></li>
	<li><font size="4">The creation of a &ldquo;trigger event&rdquo; (a report on enrollment and capacity utilization at the end of the school year) to enable the board to decide whether to initiate the procedure, including the creation of the Community Advisory Committee (CAC) as a board- and superintendent-appointed committee comprised of individuals from professional and educational communities that could bring expertise to the group&rsquo;s deliberations. </font></li>
	<li><font size="4">A timeline lasting approximately nine months, from the decision of the board to begin a study through to the board&rsquo;s decision on the recommendations of the CAC. </font></li>
	<li><font size="4">Improved community engagement through CAC meetings, a first and second reading of the board report on changes to school utilization, with community meetings held between the two readings to gather more input. </font></li>
	<li><font size="4">The inclusion of the &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; framework from the California Department of Education.</font></li>
</ul>

The funding of two proposed new supervisory job classes to cover a day and evening shift totals $214,834; the existing budgeted positions to be eliminated include Fleet Maintenance Compliance Coordinator $99,455; difference in manager salary $16,193; Lead Automotive Repair Technician $95,479; total existing costs with benefits total $211,127. This results in an overall annual increase of $3,707.47 within the adopted budget.</font><b><font size="4"><br><br>BACKGROUND: </font></b><font size="4">Human Resources staff was asked to review the organizational structure of Transportation Services with focus on Fleet Maintenance. To further refine the recent reorganization based on operational needs, Human Resources is recommending the establishment of two supervisory job classes, Garage Supervisor and Assistant Garage Supervisor in conjunction with the abolishment of the Fleet Maintenance Compliance Supervisor job class. The latter will eliminate funding a supervisory position that supervises a program versus personnel. The proposed new job classes will be responsible for planning, organizing and front-line supervision of personnel and activities specific to vehicle and equipment maintenance and repair functions. These recommendations appropriately recognize the need to resolve safety concerns relative to the current lack of night supervisory personnel which will allow the Manager, Fleet Maintenance to focus on broader issues including compliance and overall fleet needs. Upon approval, Human Resources can proceed with reemployment and recruitment activities.

Approval of this job classification will result in an annual savings of approximately $122,000. The position will be funded by Proposition S, and the total cost will not exceed the amount of $113,000 per year, including benefits.</font><b><font size="4"><br><br>BACKGROUND:</font></b><font size="4"> District facilities must be long-lasting, state-of-the-art, and able to be utilized effectively. Project specifications of the highest quality are integral to accomplish those goals. The Senior Specification Writer position is critical to the efficient, timely, cost-effective, and quality assurance/control aspects of project contract document preparation for both bond and non-bond projects. The position will help ensure facility continuity with respect to product specifications and decrease the potential for change order occurrences during the course of a construction effort. Producing a high quality set of contract documents further translates to additional benefits relative to project approval processes via the Division of the State Architect (DSA); and ultimately leads to cost-effective, high quality, timely performances by contractors as projects are constructed, so that the actual facility and classroom environment occupied on a daily basis by students and faculty greatly enhances the teaching and learning experience. Approval to establish this new job classification will allow for the recruitment process to begin.

San Diego City College has several active projects with Garfield High School and the small schools at San Diego High Educational Complex (SDHEC). The STEP-UP Biotechnology collaboration between SDCCD and the district, made possible through a grant award to the SDCCD from the San Diego Workforce Partnership (SDWF), requires the development of curriculum and sequencing/alignment between the district and SDCCD. The goal of the three-year project, currently proposing year two, is to support a biotechnology educational pipeline to industry. This will allow district ROP teachers, in the industry sector of Health Sciences and Medical Technology, district core curriculum science teachers, and SDCCD professors of biomedical technology to collaborate, develop and implement curriculum to prepare students to enter a biotechnology pipeline at City College. Successful completion of the intended program would consist of a Multiple Pathways approach of completion of a high school sequence of courses, consisting of two college level biotechnology courses, and an internship leading to permanent placement in various biotechnology labs throughout the city.

The purpose of the Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program (HPRP) is to provide housing for homeless and at-risk households.  HPRP will provide temporary financial assistance, housing relocation and stabilization services.  It is intended to target two populations of persons facing housing instability: families who are currently in housing but at risk of becoming homeless and in need of temporary rent or utility assistance (prevention); and families who are experiencing homelessness (rapid re-housing).</font><p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The district began dialogue with the Housing Commission in March 2009.  Discussion centered around the unique positon of the district to partner with the Housing Commission because of the trust families have in school staff and the consequent sharing of living environment struggles.  This allows for early intervention.</font><p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Based on data from the district's student information system for September 2009, the district has between 1100-1200 homeless students enrolled on a given day.  If families have access to direct referral of this assistance early in the homeless cycle, the chances for stabilization are much greater.  Stabilization will benefit these students through improved attendance and instruction.</font><p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">[Originator/Contact: Pamela Hosmer, Program Manager, Children and Youth in Transition, Office of Arun Ramanthan, Chief Student Services Officer, 619.725.7652, phosmer@sandi.net]</font><p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B7DW0CBCCA/$FILE/SDhousingCommission.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B7DW0CBCCA/Body/0.C68?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="133" height="47" alt="SDhousingCommission.pdf" border="0"></a></div>

The System of Care is based on Child and Adolescent Service System Program (CASSP) System of Care principles and the Wraparound Initiative of the State of California.<br><br>According to the Policy Leadership Cadre for Mental Health in Schools, May 2001, there is a need to create a cohesive framework of mental health services for students and families with mental health needs. This framework should weave school-owned resources and community resources together and connect in major ways to the mission of schools. Mental health services in schools need to be viewed as essential to addressing barriers to learning and not as an agenda separate from the schools' instructional mission. Traditional referral and treatment of students with mental health needs through schools has been difficult for families to access and more integration between mental health services and schools is necessary to monitor the quality of treatment, particularly in relationship to expected educational outcomes.<br><br>San Diego Unified School District recognized the need for the screening and identification of students who have unmet mental health needs that impair their educational performance and the need to provide and coordinate quality mental health services at their school sites. Through the district's contracts with the County of San Diego, Health and Human Services Agency, the district has established a Mental Health Resource Center to provide and/or integrate the mental health services necessary to give students the optimum opportunity to achieve. The MHRC coordinates the services of community mental health providers with district mental health support services to provide a continuum of mental health services to district students and their families.<br><br>The provider's primary functions will be to provide medication, assessment, and treatment services to individual students, interdisciplinary team consultation to individual programs, and in-services and staff consultation to other district schools as assigned. Overall programmatic consultation will be provided to the Program Manager of the Mental Health Resource Center as needed.<br><br>[Originator/Contact: Shirley Culver, Program Manager, Mental Health Resource Center, Office of the Chief Student Services Officer, 858.573.2227, sculver@sandi.net]</font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B7E40CBD1A/$FILE/Contract_PATEL_2009-2010.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B7E40CBD1A/Body/0.DF6?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="163" height="47" alt="Contract_PATEL_2009-2010.pdf" border="0"></a></div>

Contract completion date is estimated to be May 28, 2010. </font><p><b><font size="4">FISCAL IMPACT:</font></b><font size="4"> Ten bids for this project were received on September 10, 2009, ranging from $3,507,000 to $3,920,000. Riha Construction Co. has been determined to be the low responsive and responsible bidder with a base bid of $3,507,000. The district has accepted additive alternate no.1 for $5,000, for a total contract value of $3,512,000, which is within the district's budget. Budget Sources: 8808 77100 00 6200 8500 0000 35000 0000.  </font><p><font size="4">Public Contract Code section 20111 requires a school district to competitively bid public works valued at $15,000 or more.  Under Public Contract Code Section 20114, the district must contract this work because it exceeds the force account limitations for performing the work with in-house forces. </font><p><b><font size="4">BACKGROUND:</font></b><font size="4"> On January 13, 2009, the board approved the building of a cold storage facility using State School Facilities Funds for the Food Service Department. The building, to be located at the Cardinal Lane Supply Center warehouse site, shall comprise a 10,000 square foot freezer and a 2,000 square foot cold room with a loading dock with loading bays. The Cardinal Lane site is a central location that is currently used for storing bulk non-perishable food required for the district's preparatory kitchens. </font><p><font size="4">Currently, the Food Service Department rents space in a cold storage facility in National City at a cost of approximately $400,000 per year. It is estimated that the annual, operating cost savings after construction of the new freezer facility would net an annual cost savings of approximately $440,000. This savings would mean a pay-back of the initial capital investment in approximately 8 years. </font><p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">[Originator/Contact: Chuck Brown, Director, Facilities Planning and Construction, Office of the Executive Director, 2008 Capital Improvement Bond Program, 858.637.3686, </font><a href="mailto:cbrown1@sandi.net"><u><font size="4" color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman">cbrown1@sandi.net</font></u></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">]</font><p><font size="4"> </font><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B7F80CBFF3/$FILE/CC-90-122-29%20Bid%20Agreement.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B7F80CBFF3/Body/0.A52?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="163" height="47" alt="CC-90-122-29 Bid Agreement.pdf" border="0"></a></div>

These children, who are not identified as special education students, often act out in the classroom, are punished, fall behind academically, and repeat the cycle of misbehavior. They become prime candidates to eventually drop out of school. For many of these children who lack consistent adult support, school constitutes the most organized, consistent facet of their lives and a critical opportunity for receiving adult support. <br><br>Informed by research in the fields of school-based mental health and youth resiliency, as well as by focus groups at the participating schools, the Opening Doors Pilot Program aims to ensure that schools address the needs of the whole child. This includes helping students move from risk to resiliency and to achieve academic and social success in primary and secondary schools and beyond; helping teachers promote more positive behavior in the classroom and create more engaging learning environments for at-risk students; and helping families create the kind of stable, structured, emotionally and physically healthy environments that contribute to the academic and social success of their children. The program calls for the creation of a school leadership team that will put in place a set of comprehensive interventions for students, families and teachers for five targeted students at each school. Intervention therapists/caseworkers, with the support of school leadership teams, will ensure that disengaged students become connected to services in each of the following areas: creative outlets, academic support, recreational opportunities, emotional counseling, and social supports. <br><br>[Originator/Contact: Arun Ramanathan, Chief Student Services Officer, 619.725.5678, </font><a href="mailto:aramanathan@sandi.net"><u><font size="4" color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman">aramanathan@sandi.net</font></u></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">]</font><p><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B7FB0CC023/$FILE/moa.jacobs.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B7FB0CC023/Body/0.F20?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="80" height="47" alt="moa.jacobs.pdf" border="0"></a></div>

<div class="itembody"><b><font size="4">RECOMMENDATION: </font></b><font size="4"> Recommend approval of the application for K-3 Class Size Reduction for the FY 2009-10.  </font><p><b><font size="4">FISCAL IMPACT: </font></b><font size="4"> The funding for this project will be provided by the California Department of Education School Facilities Planning Division for a total award of $32,411,673.00.  Budget string:  0000 00010 00 8980 0000 01000.</font><p><b><font size="4">BACKGROUND:</font></b><font size="4">  The K-3 Class Size Reduction Program allocates funds to school districts for participating schools to reduce class size in K-3 classrooms.  Special education students enrolled in special day classes are excluded from enrollment counts.  Teachers providing direct instruction in reduced-size classes must participate in staff development including methods of providing individualized instruction, effective teaching in smaller classes, identifying and responding to pupil needs, and building on individual strengths of pupils.  Allocation of funding to the district is based on $1,071 per student enrolled in a reduced-size class.  The district participated in the K-3 Class Size Reduction Program in 2008-09 and proposes to apply for funding to continue to implement class size reduction in 1,812 district K-3 classes.  This will affect a total of 38,435 K-3 students in the district.</font><p><font size="4">[Originator/Contact:  Ami Shackelford, Director Financial Operations, Office of the Chief Financial Officer, 619.260.5465, </font><a href="mailto:ashackelford@sandi.net"><u><font size="4" color="#0000FF">ashackelford@sandi.net</font></u></a><font size="4">]</font><p><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B7FL0CC132/$FILE/K-3%20Class%20Size%20Reduction%20Resolution.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B7FL0CC132/Body/0.792?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="198" height="47" alt="K-3 Class Size Reduction Resolution.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B7FL0CC132/$FILE/K-3%20Class%20Size%20Reduction%20Application%20FY%202009-10.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B7FL0CC132/Body/0.12A2?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="258" height="47" alt="K-3 Class Size Reduction Application FY 2009-10.pdf" border="0"></a></div>
