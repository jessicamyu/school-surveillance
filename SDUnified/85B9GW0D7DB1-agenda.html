The renewal of the charter petition shall become effective on July 1, 2009. The potential fiscal impact to the district is an estimated loss of $2,032,000 generated in average daily attendance in 2009-10 because district does not receive any average daily attendance funds for students enrolled at charter schools. District staff has analyzed the school&#8217;s academic performance, financial viability, charter petition, and results from a staff review and found that the school has met requirements to continue performing as a charter school in the San Diego Unified School District.</font><font size="4"><br></font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>[Originator/Contact: Dr. Rich Cansdale, Chief School Innovation and Choice Officer, 858.627.7408, rcansdale@sandi.net]</font><font size="4"><br><br>(A complete copy of the charter petition can be found online or by contacting the Board Services Office at 619.725.5550) </font><br><br><font size="4"> </font><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B9HU0D804A/$FILE/HTM%20Media%20Arts%20Board%20Report%20Final.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B9HU0D804A/Body/0.68E?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="194" height="47" alt="HTM Media Arts Board Report Final.pdf" border="0"></a><font size="4">  </font><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B9HU0D804A/$FILE/HTMMA%202009_13_05%20FINAL%20FINAL%20VERSION.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B9HU0D804A/Body/0.12D6?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="246" height="47" alt="HTMMA 2009_13_05 FINAL FINAL VERSION.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B9HU0D804A/$FILE/Final%20for%20brd%20appr_HTH%20Student%20Handbook%202009%20-%20Revised%20Draft%2005_12_09%20for%20Renewal.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B9HU0D804A/Body/0.245E?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="439" height="47" alt="Final for brd appr_HTH Student Handbook 2009 - Revised Draft 05_12_09 for Renewal.pdf" border="0"></a></div>

<div class="itembody"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Office of School Innovation and Choice (OSIC) recommends the board approve the renewal charter petition for High Tech Middle Charter School (High Tech Middle) for a five-year charter term beginning on July 1, 2009, and expiring on June 30, 2014. OSIC recommends the adoption of this staff report as findings in support of the board&#8217;s decision to renew the charter petition. High Tech Middle was originally board-approved on February 25, 2003, was renewed on June 20, 2008, and is seeking a new renewal charter term that will expire on June 30, 2009. The renewal of the charter shall become effective on July 1, 2009. The potential fiscal impact to the district is an estimated loss of $2,014,000 generated in average daily attendance in 2009-10 because the district does not receive any average daily attendance funds for students enrolled at charter schools.

<div class="itembody"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Office of School Innovation and Choice (OSIC) recommends the Board of Education adopt the amendments to the charter for Urban Discovery Academy (UDA) Charter School. The amendments include a request to increase the grade offerings to include a 7th and 8th grade academic program. UDA currently has nine 6th graders enrolled and this amendment would allow them to maintain this cohort in 7th grade in 2009-10. The potential fiscal impact to the district is an estimated loss of $170,000 generated in average daily attendance because the district does not receive any average daily attendance funds for students enrolled at charter schools. OSIC received amendments for the UDA on May 5, 2009. The amendments shall become effective June 3, 2009, and will expire with the original term of the charter petition, June 30, 2013. The UDA petitioners submitted their amendments to the district for review and consideration of approval in accordance with education code requirements. Staff has reviewed the amendments and found them to meet legal, fiscal, and operational requirements. Staff recommends the adoption of this report as findings in support of the board&#8217;s decision to approve the amendments to the UDA charter petition. </font><p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">[Originator/Contact: Dr. Rich Cansdale, Chief School Innovation and Choice Officer, 858.627.7408, </font><a href="mailto:rcansdale@sandi.net"><font size="4" color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman">rcansdale@sandi.net</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">]</font><p><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B9J50D818D/$FILE/UDA%20AMENDMENTS%20BOARD%20REPORT.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B9J50D818D/Body/0.72E?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="218" height="47" alt="UDA AMENDMENTS BOARD REPORT.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B9J50D818D/$FILE/uda%20charter%20material%20revision%20submitted%205%2018%2009.%20Clean%20Copy.pdf"><img src="/ca/sandi/Board.nsf/legacy-content/85B9J50D818D/Body/0.14BE?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="305" height="47" alt="uda charter material revision submitted 5 18 09.
