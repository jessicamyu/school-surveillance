<div class="itembody"><font size="4">The Office of School Choice recommends the Board of Education approve the amendments to the charter for the Museum School.  The amendments include; a request to change the name of the school, modify the grade configuration of the school in order to offer a K-6 program, a description of the academic program to be provided in grades K-2, a change in the school&#8217;s Governance Council, a procedure to meet NCLB requirements, acknowledgement of compliance with the District's collective bargaining agreement, removal of admissions preferences, and removal of references to rescinded charter policy.  The potential fiscal impact to the District is an estimated loss of $675,000 generated in average daily attendance because SDUSD does not receive any average daily attendance funds for students enrolled at charter schools. The Office of School Choice received amendments for the Museum School on February 6, 2008.  The amendments shall become effective March 26, 2008 and will expire with the original term of the charter petition, June 30, 2010.  The Museum School petitioners submitted their amendments to the District for review and consideration of approval in accordance with Education Code requirements.  Staff has reviewed the amendments and found them to meet legal, fiscal, and operational requirements.  Staff recommends the adoption of this report as findings in support of the Board&#8217;s decision to approve the amendments to the Museum School charter petition.

<div class="itembody"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Office of School Choice recommends the Board of Education approve the renewal charter petition for KIPP Adelante Preparatory Academy Charter School (KIPP) for a five-year charter term beginning on July 2, 2008, and expiring on July 1, 2013.    The Office of School Choice recommends the adoption of this staff report as findings in support of the Board&#8217;s decision to renew the charter petition.  KIPP was originally approved in March 25, 2003.  The current charter term expires on July 1, 2008.  The renewal of the charter shall become effective on July 2, 2008.  Though staff recommends renewal, through the course of the renewal review some concerns were identified, particularly with the school&#8217;s plan for special education and English language learners, procedures for ensuring parental involvement, conflict of interest policy, and health and safety policies and procedures.  The petitioners have corrected the issues identified by staff.  These changes are reflected in the final renewal petition.  The potential fiscal impact to the San Diego Unified School District (SDUSD) is an estimated loss of $1,784,443 generated in average daily attendance because SDUSD does not receive any average daily attendance funds for students enrolled at charter schools.  Staff has analyzed the school&#8217;s academic performance, financial viability, charter petition, and results from an independent review and found that the school has met requirements to continue performing as a charter school in SDUSD.

The October fires constitute that emergency. The District has determined that ADA was measurably lower after the schools re-opened for the period October 31, 2007 through November 16, 2007, than it was in the timeframe immediately prior to the school closures.

Fence Specialties, Inc. offered the lowest prices for many items in this bid when it was originally  awarded. The proposed price increases sought by Fence Specialties, Inc. will still result in the lowest prices on many of the bid items.  Materials will be purchased from the low bidder first, and, if unavailable from that vendor, then from the next lowest bidder. Agreement effective May 12, 2007 through May 11, 2010.

A series of seminars were held in the Fall 2007.  On December 21, 2007, seven (7) staff from both the Procurement and Contracts Department and the Construction Management Department satisfactorily completed a 240 question written examination and earned their professional certification as a Certified Professional Public Buyer (CPPB).  As a result of this accomplishment, 10% of all the CPPB&#8217;s in the State of California are now employed by SDUSD.  In order to continue to enhance the body of public procurement knowledge that is necessary for the District&#8217;s staff in both these departments to possess when performing their jobs, additional seminars are being held.  Completion of these seminars will then qualify an additional five (5) staff to be examined.
