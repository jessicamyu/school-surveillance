<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>FISCAL IMPACT</strong>: None.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>PRIOR YEAR FISCAL IMPACT</strong>: None.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>IMPACT TO DISTRICT STAFFING</strong>: </span></span><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">None.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>CONSULTATION WITH BOARD ADVISORY COMMITTEE: </strong>The District Advisory Council (DAC) received training regarding specific plan requirements</span>. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>: As a result of SB 374, the state holds each district school accountable for developing and implementing a Single Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA). The SPSA identifies the instructional needs of students and specifies how school funding, including categorical funds provided through the Consolidated Application, will be used to accomplish the goals outlined in the plan. The SPSA is developed or modified through an annual planning cycle.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The School Site Council (SSC), in collaboration with the site instructional leadership team, is responsible for developing, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating the SPSA. Site principals, SSC chairpersons, SSC members, and the District Advisory Council for Compensatory Education (DAC) received training regarding specific plan requirements. Each school's School Site Council (SSC) works with its site instructional leadership team and district staff to develop, implement, monitor, and evaluate its SPSA.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Additionally, the Financial Planning, Monitoring, and Accountability staff provided individual support to principals and site teams to discuss Title I expenditures and the SPSA development process. Sites then developed their SPSAs, had them approved by their SSCs, and submitted them to their area superintendents for review. Area superintendents reviewed plans to ensure schools identified student needs and aligned their goals with appropriate courses of action to address those needs.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Once approved by area superintendents, the plans were forwarded to the Financial Planning, Monitoring, and Accountability Department where staff reviewed each plan and provided individual assistance to schools to ensure that their SPSAs met state requirements and that the plans and associated categorical budget allocations were in alignment. The local governing board must review and approve each school's SPSA. This report brings forward for board approval the 2018-19 SPSAs and categorical budget summaries for 176 schools.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">A copy of each 2018-19 SPSA, which includes the budget summaries and required signed Assurances page is available in the Board Services Office, Eugene Brucker Education Center, 4100 Normal Street, Room 2231, San Diego, CA 92103.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>BACKGROUND: </strong>District membership renewals are reviewed by the board on an annual basis.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">These organizations work nationally, in the State of California, and locally to promote education through legislative advocacy and programs aimed at improving the quality of urban education. Education Code Section 35172 allows governing boards to subscribe to memberships and appoint representatives to attend meetings of any association of which their purpose is to promote or advance public education. Traditionally, three board members serve as delegates for the California School Boards Association (<span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="CSBA">CSBA</span>) and San Diego County School Boards Association (<span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="SDCSBA">SDCSBA</span>), and the Board President serves as the delegate for the Council of the Great City Schools (<span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="CGCS">CGCS</span>). Currently, Trustees Barrera, McQuary and Whitehurst-Payne are delegates to CSBA. Funds have been budgeted for these memberships for 2018-19.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">At the February 20, 2018 Board Governance session, the Board made a budgetary decision to reduce expenses and not join the National School Boards Association (NSBA) for the 2018-19 fiscal year. In addition, the Board decided to continue the practice of not expending Board Services funds on travel and conference fees during the 2018-19 year.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>: <span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Pursuant to Education Code section 47607, a material revision of the provisions of a charter petition may be made only with the approval of the authority that granted the charter. Renewals and material revisions of the charters are governed by the standards and criteria in Section 47605, and shall include, but not be limited to, a reasonably comprehensive description of any new requirement of charter schools enacted into law after the charter was originally granted or last renewed.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Staff recommends the board grant the requested revisions to the charter of The Learning Choice Academy to remove the out of district sites located in La Mesa and Chula Vista from the charter, effective July 1, 2018.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span verdana="">The Learning Choice Academy (“LCA”) began operating in 2004, and currently serves Grades K-12 at the following four sites:</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">On January 18, 2017, the California Supreme Court declined to review a decision issued on October 17, 2016, by the Third District Court of Appeals in the <i>Anderson Union High School District v. Shasta Secondary Home School</i> (“<i>Anderson</i>”) case. The appellate ruling held that current statutes do not permit a nonclassroom-based charter school to locate resource centers outside of the geographic boundaries of the authorizing school district but within the same county.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">On March 11, 2014, prior to the <i>Anderson</i> ruling, the district renewed LCA’s charter petition that included the four sites identified above. In the Affirmations and Assurances section of the current charter petition, LCA indicated that the charter school “shall comply with any jurisdictional limitations to locations of its facilities. [Ref. Education Code Sections 47605 and 47605.1]”</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">In response to the <i>Anderson</i> ruling, on March 9, 2017, the State, in an effort to provide a transition period for affected charter schools, provided a waiver term through June 30, 2018, for schools to get their sites compliant. We did not submit a waiver on behalf of LCA, but they were afforded this time period to get their sites compliant.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">On July 10, 2015, the district sent a letter to LCA notifying it of the need to transition all of its sites located outside of the district’s boundaries into compliance with the Charter Schools Act. Since this initial letter, the following communications have occurred between the district and LCA regarding the need to get sites compliant.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">LCA’s continued operation of the La Mesa site under the current district-approved charter petition may subject the district to litigation and liability. The court has ruled that the geographic restrictions currently in statute are applicable to nonclassroom-based charter schools, and the transition period provided by the State for charter operators to get their sites compliant ends on June 30, 2018. After this date, the district whose boundary LCA is unlawfully operating in may opt to pursue litigation against San Diego Unified School District and the charter school over the non-compliant site.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">If LCA continues to operate the La Mesa site after June 30, 2018, this will directly violate the court ruling and the Charter Schools Act. This violation of law would form the basis for the district to issue a Notice of Violation, the first step in the Revocation process. If the district initiated the revocation process, it would apply to the LCA charter petition, not a specific site.</span></span></p>

<div class="itembody"><p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) is an essential element of California's Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF). It is a three-year, district-level plan that is updated annually. The 2018-19 LCAP is the second year of the three-year plan. The plan describes the school district's key goals for students as well as the actions (with expenditures) the district will take to achieve the goals and the measures used to indicate progress. The LCAP&nbsp;also includes an Annual Update, which reflects the implementation of the current year's LCAP&nbsp;(2017-18). The San Diego Unified School District has aligned its six LCAP goals and supporting actions and expenditures to the board-adopted Vision 2020 Quality Schools in Every Neighborhood.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>RECOMMENDATION: </strong>Conduct a public hearing and adopt the district's proposed&nbsp;2018-19 Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP). The 2018-19 content was presented to the Board of Education and the public on June 7, 2018, along with specific implementation plans for the 2018-19 school year. The 2018-19 LCAP&nbsp;document was presented to the Board of Education at a public hearing and first reading on June 19, 2018. This is the second and final reading of the district's proposed 2018-19 LCAP.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>CONSULTATION WITH BOARD ADVISORY COMMITTEE:&nbsp;</strong>The District Advisory Council (DAC) and the District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC) serve as the district's LCAP advisory committees. During 2017-18, updates on LCAP&nbsp;implementation were presented to the board and public at regular board meetings, and the presentations were available on the district's LCAP&nbsp;webpage for dissemination to all stakeholders. The early draft 2018-19 LCAP was presented to the DAC on May 16, 2018, and to the DELAC on May 17, 2018, for review and comment. The district received questions and comments from the DELAC&nbsp;in mid-June, which are attached to this item along with staff responses. The district also received questions and comments from the DAC in mid-June. Responses to the DAC's&nbsp;questions and comments will be provided by the end of July. The full LCAP document is posted on&nbsp;the district website&nbsp; at https://www.sandiegounified.org/what-lcap. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>: The&nbsp;LCAP is intended to be a comprehensive planning tool. For school districts, pursuant to Education Code Section 52060, the LCAP&nbsp;must describe, for the school district and each school within the district, goals and specific actions to achieve those goals for all students and each subgroup of students in Education Code Section 52052, including students with disabilities, for each of the state priorities and any locally identified&nbsp;priorities.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The district's local priorities (LCAP&nbsp;Goals are):</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">1. <strong>Closing the Achievement Gap with High Expectations for All:</strong> All levels of the organization work to improve student achievement and close the achievement gap for all underperforming student groups.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">2. <strong>Access to Broad and Challenging Curriculum:</strong> Students have equitable access to rigorous, well-rounded, standards-aligned curricula and access to and skill in applying technologies to leverage learning, assuring readiness for a full range of post-graduation options.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>CONSULTATION WITH BOARD ADVISORY COMMITTEE: </strong>The District Advisory Council (DAC) discussed the proposed Title I Budget Plan on September 21, 2017, November 15, 2017, December 13, 2017, January 17, 2018, February 21, 2018, and May 16, 2018.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>: The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965 was reauthorized as of December 10, 2015 as the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). Title I, one of several programs under ESSA, provides funds to schools to help disadvantaged children meet challenging academic standards. The law intends that the funds go to the district and schools that have the highest concentrations of poverty. Title I requires funding to be allocated to a district based on the number of "children in poverty" residing within the district boundary. The federal census is used to identify children ages five through seventeen living in poverty who are included in the calculation of Title I entitlement.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">District leadership is charged with designing a plan that meets legislative requirements while producing sustainable support that will positively impact</span> student learning and significantly raise achievement over time. To that end, at its January 23, 2018 meeting, the board approved the school allocation method (Title I Ranking Report) and anticipated Title I revenue for 2018-19. The 2018-19 proposed Title I Budget (attachment) allocated the same overall amount to schools in 2018-19 that they collectively received in 2017-18.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>CONSULTATION WITH BOARD ADVISORY COMMITTEE: </strong>The district's Instructional Calendar Committee&nbsp;includes representatives from the Community Advisory Committee on Special Education (CAC), District Advisory Council on Compensatory Education (DAC), and the District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC).</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>CONSULTATION WITH ADDITIONAL STAKEHOLDER GROUPS: </strong>&nbsp;The district's Instructional Calendar Committee includes representatives from the Associated Student Body (ASB) and all bargaining units as per contract language (Administrators Association San Diego [AASD], Operations Support Services [OSS], Office-Technical and Business Services [OTBS], Paraeducators [PARA], Police Officers Association [POA], and the San Diego Education Association [SDEA]). &nbsp;The Parent Teacher Association (PTA) and cluster representatives were invited to participate. &nbsp;Information about the Calendar Committee is posted on the district website at http://sdusdfamilies.org/instructional-calendar-committee.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>: &nbsp;The Instructional Calendar Committee met twice as a full committee during the 2017-18 school year to discuss start and end dates for the 2019-20 and 2020-21 school years. &nbsp;The meetings were held on April 23, 2018 and June 8, 2018. During the period between meetings, Committee members had the opportunity to&nbsp;engage&nbsp;with their stakeholder groups and conduct&nbsp;outreach to their constituents. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">At the April 23, 2018 meeting, the Committee was provided with a summary&nbsp;the Committee's in-depth work of the&nbsp;previous year in which the factors shown below were&nbsp;discussed and considered at length. The Committee requested that the Superintendent make the 2019-20 and 2020-21&nbsp;instructional calendar recommendations to the Board prior to the end of June. &nbsp;Previous considerations include:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Air conditioning installation -&nbsp;estimated to be complete by the end of the 2018-19 school year for all learning spaces&nbsp;</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Advanced Placement (AP) exams -&nbsp;held in early May (schedule set by the College Board)&nbsp;</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Attendance during the first five days of school -&nbsp;no significant drop in attendance since&nbsp;the district began its pre-Labor Day start&nbsp;</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Charter school calendars -&nbsp;most are aligned with San Diego Unified</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) schedules -&nbsp;fall sports practices and games begin in early- to-mid August; student attendance promotes school spirit and provides ASB opportunities</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Community college -&nbsp;high school students participating in classes on the community college campuses start mid-August&nbsp;</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Conversion of the last three clusters (Crawford, Hoover, San Diego)&nbsp;from year round to traditional calendars -&nbsp;on indefinite hold due to budget considerations&nbsp;</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Elementary achievement -&nbsp;no evidence of impact on student achievement by starting pre-Labor Day&nbsp;</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Energy consumption in August -&nbsp;increases each year as additional schools are equipped with air conditioning&nbsp;</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) deadlines&nbsp;-&nbsp;the district must submit student information by October 1 (was previously January 1)</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Federal Survey Cards -&nbsp;not impacted by school start date</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Financial savings/average daily attendance (ADA) -&nbsp;no financial impact expected by continuing to begin the Monday&nbsp;prior to Labor Day; financial impact will be experienced during conversion of additional clusters from year-round to traditional schedules</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Los Angeles Unified's instructional calendar -&nbsp;includes a mid-August start with first semester ending before Winter Break</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Scholastic Aptitude&nbsp;Test (SAT) -&nbsp;exam is now offered in late August</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Other districts in San Diego County - all begin prior to Labor Day;&nbsp;even beginning the Monday&nbsp;prior to Labor Day,&nbsp;San Diego Unified is among the latest start districts in the county</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Temperatures in San Diego&nbsp;-&nbsp;hot weather may occur in August, September, October and even November</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">On June 8, 2018, the Committee reconvened to share stakeholder input and make its recommendation to the Superintendent. Committee members were allowed to make recommendations in person or by e-mail. &nbsp;Of the Committee's 28 members, 22 participated in the recommendation process, with 13&nbsp;recommending to continue with a pre-Labor Day start and nine recommending to revert to a post-Labor Day start.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>CONSULTATION WITH BOARD ADVISORY COMMITTEE: </strong>Not applicable.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>: </span><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">In an effort to continue the improvement of procedures and processes for centralized procurement and contracting district-wide, a new process will be implemented for streamlining Independent Contractor Agreements. The goal is to limit and reduce the number of contracted service items that are included in this item for approval via the ratification process. Ratification is an after-the-fact request for the board to approve services already provided or being provided at the time the Independent Contractors Agreement (ICA) is presented for approval.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Executive Leadership should work with requestors to reduce and eliminate the need for ratified ICA's. Effective immediately, after an ICA is submitted to and approved by the respective Executive Leadership/Instructional Cabinet team member, it will then be sent to the Strategic Sourcing and Contracts Department. The ICA will include a requisition number that pre-encumbers the funding for payment of the ICA after services are completed.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>: California Senate Bill (SB) 833 was passed in 2016 to address the opioid epidemic by increasing the availability of&nbsp;naloxone, a relatively safe medication that is used to treat potentially fatal opioid-related&nbsp;overdoses. On March 27, 2017, the California Department of Public Health released a non-competitive, one-time&nbsp;Request for Application (RFA) for naloxone&nbsp;distribution&nbsp;from $3 million funding allocated to the state's general fund for SB 833. The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency and other local health departments were encouraged to accept the medications and administrative funding. San Diego County will be allocated with 6,622 doses of naloxone&nbsp;nasal spray. Once the agreement is approved, the district will request naloxone kits for all secondary school sites at no-cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>:&nbsp;In accordance with California Education Code Sections 46600 to 46608 and Section 48204, school districts may establish Interdistrict Attendance Agreements which provide for an exchange of students from one district to another district. An Interdistrict Attendance Agreement allows students to enroll in school districts other than their resident district when there are childcare, employment, residential, academic program or other factors which&nbsp;affect&nbsp;a student&#39;s enrollment at&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:14px;">the school</span><span style="font-size:14px;">.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;">On April 29, 2014, the board approved 49 five-year Interdistrict Attendance Agreements&nbsp;with several School Districts and Lakeside Union School District was part of the approved participating districts.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;">This recommendation approves&nbsp;a four-year (2019-2023) Interdistrict Attendance Agreement with Lakeside Union School District.</span></p>

SELF is a member-owned, statewide partnership of public educational agencies providing quality pooled programs for excess coverage. The district currently purchases excess liability insurance in excess of $5 million from SELF. </span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:" verdana="">The significant increase in premium reflects the insurance market’s response to high dollar verdicts and settlements in California schools, including traumatic brain injuries, molestation, and abuse cases. Legislative efforts to eliminate the statute of limitations for recovery of damages in abuse cases, including repressed memory sexual abuse cases, are also a factor. This unpredictability has led to insurers demanding higher premiums, and/or higher retentions, and in some cases, abandonment of the California market. The SELF board accordingly raised its coverage rates to ensure sufficient funding for anticipated future losses.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><b>BACKGROUND</b>: The Proposed Project would involve the construction of an approximately 35,050-square-foot, two-story classroom building on the southeastern side of the Junipero Serra High School (Serra High School), along with campus site improvements. Construction of the new building would necessitate removal of the landscaped area currently consisting of a large grass lawn with trees and Stai Court.&nbsp; This classroom building would include 16 general classrooms; collaboration spaces; core functions such as restrooms, utility spaces, and an elevator; and an outdoor collaborative classroom.&nbsp; The classroom building and associated site work would be Americans with Disabilities Act compliant and include accessible restrooms and drinking fountains.&nbsp; An outdoor assembly area interrelated with the new classroom building and the rest of the campus would also be constructed. Implementation of the Proposed Project would be completed in five phases over a fifteen month period.&nbsp; The new classroom building, with 16 classrooms, would replace 12 temporary portable classrooms on site, which would be removed as part of the Proposed Project.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Campus improvements would include the following: a complete replacement of the existing campus walkways and existing nonfunctional underground storm drainage system, repair or replacement of damaged sewer lines, improvement of accessibility to all facilities to comply with Americans with Disabilities Act accessibility regulations, replacement or repair of damaged or broken hardscape surfaces where needed, upgrades to the existing landscaping and irrigation, renovation of the main pedestrian and vehicle entry to campus, installation of a stage lift in the auditorium, upgrades to the south parking lot, north bus lanes, and installation of site perimeter fencing.

<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><b>BACKGROUND</b>: The Proposed Project is a multi-phase, major reconstruction and reconfiguration of the existing San Diego Cooperative Charter School site. The Proposed Project would be implemented in four phases over an approximately seven to eight year period.&nbsp; The Proposed Project includes the replacement of existing aging classrooms with the construction of a new two-story building with 18 general use classrooms, one science classroom, and a media center; construction of a new multi-purpose building with food service area, art, music, and dance classrooms; construction of new kindergarten and administration facilities; construction of a new playground, garden, and shade area for students; reconstruction of the existing parking lots and new student pick-up/drop-off areas; and a new access to Genesee Ave; reconfiguration of existing onsite six-inch sewer line; and associated site work, fencing, paving, landscaping and signage.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">The Proposed Project would not increase the existing student enrollment capacity of the school because it would not increase the number of classrooms currently on the project site. Upon project completion, the newly improved campus would better meet the needs of a middle school, provide better security, and provide a better learning environment. The proposed improvements are further described below by phase:</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Phase 1 (2018&ndash;20) would include demolition of the existing play areas and construction of a new two-story classroom building, new staff parking area, new student pick-up/drop off area, and new exit-only driveway to Genesee Avenue.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Phase 2 (2020&ndash;22) would include removal of four existing portable classrooms, demolition of the existing elementary school classroom building, and construction of a new multipurpose building and parking area.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Phases 3 (2022&ndash;24) would include demolition of the existing kindergarten/administration building, play area, and administration parking lot, and construction of a new administration building, kindergarten building and play area, and administration parking lot/kindergarten pick-up/drop-off area.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Phase 4 (2024&ndash;25) would include demolition of the existing auditorium building and play area, and construction of a new lunch shelter.</span></span></p>

This statute provides that the district may purchase personal property from contracts already competitively bid by another public agency.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">In accordance with Public Contract Code section 20118 and Page 43 of 93 of the attached contract documents, public school districts and community colleges may only order products specified in the contract at the prices specified in the contract. No labor will be associated with the purchase of the modular buildings. In-house forces and/or a publicly bid contract will be used to perform all installations of any modular classrooms and modular toilet buildings. The building to be purchased is providing additional restroom facilities at Holmes Elementary School.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">On July 8, 2014, the board received the final report from the Environmental Sustainability Advisory Committee. Included in this report as a "Dream Big" idea was a recommended action to join or create larger purchasing cooperatives. A purchasing cooperative establishes various contracts which aggregate the total purchases from many government entities resulting in lower costs to governmental entities who then utilize these contracts.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="color: black;">As indicated in the above table, Iftin&rsquo;s enrollment has been declining since the 2014-15 school year. At the end of the 2016-17 school year, as of June 14, 2017, Iftin&rsquo;s enrollment was 434. At the beginning of the 2017-18 school year, Iftin&rsquo;s enrollment was 342, a significant decline in enrollment of approximately 92 students (21.2 percent). Throughout the 2017-18 year, the school has continued to lose enrollment. As of May 20, 2018, Iftin&rsquo;s enrollment was 310. Overall, enrollment at the school has declined approximately 124 students (29 percent) since June 2017.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Section 3 (Use of Site and Facilities) and Exhibit C (Shared Use Terms) of the MFUPA state the terms and allocation percentages related to Iftin&rsquo;s shared use of the site and facilities. As stated in Exhibit C, beginning in the 2015-16 fiscal year, Iftin&rsquo;s percentage of use of the site and facilities is 89 percent.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Exhibit C states that, &ldquo;the percentages shall be reevaluated annually prior to the beginning of each fiscal year of the Terms of the Agreement, and shall be adjusted as determined by the District to reflect any changes regarding the utilization of the site.&rdquo; Per the terms of the MFUPA, district staff has reevaluated the percentages and found that, based on four years of declining enrollment, and the significant decline in enrollment in 2017-18, Iftin&rsquo;s percentage should be adjusted down to <s>65</s><em><strong> 74</strong></em> percent (number of allocated classrooms reduced from 22 to <s>14</s><em><strong> 17</strong></em>). If the percentage is not reduced, Iftin is significantly over-allocated on space compared to other charter schools who occupy district sites under an MFUPA or an annual Proposition 39 agreement. The following table provides historical enrollment data for charter schools who have district facilities under MFUPAs.</span></span></p>

The San Diego Unified School District Police Department operates completely within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City's Police Department. The City's Communication Division&nbsp;performed a comprehensive communication system upgrade to allow for more timely and seamless communications between departments&nbsp;in support of City Police, Fire, Medical, and Lifeguard operations. The implementation of the VESTA 911 ECS provides connectivity with the upgraded citywide system and also will allow 911 emergency calls from any district phone to be automatically electronically transferred to school police along with any pertinent corresponding data.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">These transactions are submitted to the board for review pursuant to Education Code sections 17604 and 17605 and&nbsp;under its delegation of authority to the district Strategic Sourcing and Contracts Officer.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>FISCAL IMPACT</strong>: Each purchase order and agreement has sufficient funds from available, site-identified budgets for the purchase.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>PRIOR&nbsp;YEAR FISCAL IMPACT</strong>: For the period May 1, 2017&nbsp;through May 31, 2017:&nbsp;$1,251,403.40.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>IMPACT TO DISTRICT STAFFING</strong>:&nbsp;None.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>CONSULTATION WITH BOARD ADVISORY COMMITTEE:&nbsp;</strong>Not applicable.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>: To allow for efficiency in the administration of a large urban school district, California Education Code section 17605 specifically allows a school district to delegate limited purchasing power, i.e., for purchases no greater than $90,200 (for the year 2018) for supplies, materials, apparatus, equipment, non-construction services not greater than $90,200, and construction services&nbsp;less than $15,000. For this reason, these types of transactions must be reviewed by the board within 60 days of the date of the transaction under Education Code section 17605. Pursuant to the authority delegated to the district Strategic Sourcing and Contracts Officer on June 13, 2017, these purchase orders have been released to the respective vendors and are being submitted for review by the board at this time. Additionally, the attached agreements were signed pursuant to the delegation of authority and, as required by Education Code section 17604, must be approved or ratified by the Board of Education.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Thus, the district has met the requirements of Education Code section 17605 with this process of reporting out the specified purchase orders under $90,200 (for the year 2018) that are not associated with any previously-approved board contracts.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
