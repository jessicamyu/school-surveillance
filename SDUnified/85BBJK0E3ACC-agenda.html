<div class="itembody"><font size="4">The Office of the Chief School Innovation and Choice Officer recommends the Board of Education approve the renewal charter petition for The Learning Choice Academy Charter School (TLC) for a five-year charter term beginning on July 1, 2009, and expiring on June 30, 2014. The Office of the Chief School Innovation and Choice Officer recommends the adoption of this staff report as findings in support of the board&#8217;s decision to renew the charter petition. TLC was originally approved on May 25, 2004 and the current charter petition expires on June 30, 2009. The renewal of the charter shall become effective on July 1, 2009. The potential fiscal impact to the San Diego Unified School District (SDUSD) is an estimated loss of $3,327,329 generated in average daily attendance in 2009-10 because SDUSD does not receive any average daily attendance funds for students enrolled at charter schools. Staff has analyzed the school&#8217;s academic performance, financial viability, charter petition, and results from a district review and found that the school has met requirements to continue performing as a charter school in SDUSD.

<div class="itembody"><font size="4">In accordance with Administrative Procedure 3105 and the Board of Education (BOE) directive on February 24, 2004, the Property Inventory and Property Management Plan (PMP) for Selected Schools is reviewed annually by district staff and the Advisory Committee on the Utilization of Excess School Property (ACUESP) to determine if any revisions are necessary.  The PMP was last amended and approved by the board on January 22, 2008.  The proposed and unmodified Property Inventory and Property Management Plan for Selected School Sites is provided as Exhibit &#8220;A&#8221;.  Exhibit &#8220;B&#8221; is a map showing the Board of Education districts and the excess school properties within each district.  Exhibit &#8220;C&#8221; is a summary of ACUESP&#8217;s thoughts and comments gained from committee discussions and site visits.  The PMP and Summary of Comments (SOC) were recently reviewed by the ACUESP, which took into account demographic and other information provided by staff.  Each site was evaluated and discussed to determine if the current designations were still appropriate.  ACUESP members toured each site location and the SOC was updated as necessary.  As part of the review, teams of committee members visited the sites and the surrounding neighborhoods and presented their findings and recommendations to the all ACUESP members.  The members, in turn, discussed the findings and recommendations for each site and ultimately there were no recommendations to change any of the site designations to the PMP, however many of the comments on the SOC, were updated to reflect the current use and to reflect updated information shared by staff.  All committee deliberations were conducted at properly noticed public meetings.</font><br><font size="4"> </font><br><font size="4">[Originator/Contact: James H.

<br />
Participating schools: Encanto Elementary, Muir, Crawford CHAMPS, Crawford IDEA, Crawford Law and Business, Crawford MVAS, Kearny Digital Media And Design, San Diego Business, San Diego CIMA, San Diego LEADS, San Diego MVP Arts, and San Diego SciTech High Schools.<br />
<br />
The Public Schools Accountability Act of 1999, requires each local Board of Education to hold a public hearing at a regular scheduled meeting to report on the progress of schools participating in certain state assistance programs. The district is also required to file an annual report with the California Department of Education (CDE) about each school and its implementation of the grant requirements (see exhibits).<br />
<br />
To receive funding, each school must develop an action plan that addresses the following: pupil literacy and achievement; quality of staff; parental involvement; and facilities, curriculum, instructional materials, and support services. The School Site Council, in partnership with the district, develops that action plan. Teachers must be involved in development of the plan, and the district must meet and consult on the plan with the exclusive representative of the certificated employees. To facilitate the planning process and provide technical expertise, the district may either contract with a state-approved external evaluator or contract with another entity that has proven successful expertise with the challenges of low-performing schools.<br />
<br />
As a condition of participation in the HPSGP, the district must also participate in two related state programs: The Mathematics and Reading Professional Development Program (AB 466) and the Principal Training Program (AB 75). AB 466 provides funding for teacher professional development to support the use of instructional materials aligned with the state standards. Teachers at low-performing schools receive first priority. AB 75 provides funding for professional development for site administrators that addresses core academic standards, curriculum frameworks and materials aligned to standards, use of pupil assessment data, instructional technology to improve pupil performance, school finance and personnel management.

If approved, the waivers will be submitted to the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing.

Attached is a roster of Career Technical Education teachers who need to have CLAD Waivers approved.</font><br><font size="4"> </font><br><font size="4">California Education Code Section 44253.1 requires all teachers to have an active and valid English Learner authorization if assigned to a classroom that has one or more students designated as an English Learner.  Because of the Williams Settlement legislation, a review of this Education Code has determined that the need for an English Learner authorization also applies to all Career Technical Education (CTE) certificated staff employed by the district.  Teachers who hold a bachelor&#8217;s degree and completed an approved teacher preparation program leading to the issuance of a regular education credential or special education credential, but did not hold an English Learner authorization, qualify for an Emergency Crosscultural, Language Academic Development (CLAD) Permit to cover them in their assignments while completing the requirements to obtain a Clear CLAD Certificate.</font><br><font size="4"> </font><br><font size="4">Due to the fact that Career Technical Education teachers are not required to hold a bachelor&#8217;s degree or complete an approved teacher preparation program to be issued a Designated Subjects Teaching Credential by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing, this sizable group of district teachers do not qualify for an Emergency CLAD Permit.  On March 19, 2008, the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing announced its approval of SB 1292 giving all holders of Designated Subjects Teaching Credentials an option to obtain an English Learner authorization.  Prior to this approval, there was no legal option available to the holder of a Designated Subjects Teaching Credential to be issued any form of English Learner authorization.  On September 26, 2008, the San Diego County Office of Education began the first session of training for qualifying teachers employed in the county.</font><br><font size="4"> </font><br><font size="4">After working with the San Diego County Office of Education, the district has been advised that all Career Technical Education teachers will need to apply for CLAD Waivers with the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing in order not to be considered mis-assigned for the 2008-09 academic school year.  These waivers will be valid for the 2008-09 school year but can be renewed for an additional year in the event the San Diego County Office of Education cannot accommodate the county&#8217;s entire population of teachers who need to complete the training.</font><br><font size="4"> </font><br><font size="4">Attached is information on the English Learner authorization requirements, SB 1292 and the San Diego County Office of Education&#8217;s English Learner training sessions.

There is no cost to the district as university students participating in the occupational therapy fieldwork training experience program do so without compensation; and district employees will be responsible for directing, coordinating and supervising the fieldwork training experience for the university student.

Due to the possibility that one firm may not have available staff when required by the district, the two lowest bidders Bekins A-1 Movers, Inc. and Oddrose Studio will each receive a contract with the district. Task orders will be issued to each firm on a project-by-project basis; however, the firm offering the lowest hourly rates for a specific task will get first call for the work. There is a significant need for school move services related to bond and Physical Plant Operations associated work. Tasks must be coordinated with construction to ensure timely performance, and assignments are on an intermittent on-call basis. Due to the nature of school moves, it is necessary to respond on very short notice in order to comply with site requests. The work includes the furnishing of all labor, materials, transportation, equipment and services for the moving and completion of work in the maximum amount of $493,400. Five bids for this project were received on December 8, 2008; one bid was disqualified because it was non-responsive. The third lowest bidder (COR-O-VAN) submitted a protest to the district requesting a review of the proposed award. Since the district has determined the claim has no merit, it has denied the firm&#8217;s claim. The total for the lowest responsive and responsible base bid is considered fair and reasonable and within the district&#8217;s budget. It is, therefore, recommended to approve award of an Agreement to Bekins A-1 Movers, Inc. in the total base bid amount of $493,400.

The goal of the CHPS program is to facilitate the design of high performance schools by improving learning environments that are energy efficient, healthy and comfortable with the amenities that are consistent with quality education.

Due to the possibility that one firm may not have available staff when required by the district, the two lowest bidders Bekins A-1 Movers, Inc. and Oddrose Studio will each receive a contract with the district. Task orders will be issued to each firm on a project-by-project basis; however, the firm offering the lowest hourly rates for a specific task will get first call for the work.  There is a significant need for school move services related to bond and Physical Plant Operations associated work.  Tasks must be coordinated with construction to ensure timely performance, and assignments are on an intermittent on-call basis. Due to the nature of school moves, it is necessary to respond on very short notice in order to comply with site requests. The work includes the furnishing of all labor, materials, transportation, equipment and services for the moving and completion of work in the maximum amount of $537,625.  Five bids for this project were received on December 8, 2008; one bid was disqualified because it was non-responsive.  The third lowest bidder (COR-O-VAN) submitted a protest to the district requesting a review of the proposed award.  Since the district has determined the claim has no merit, it has denied the firm&#8217;s claim.  The total for the second lowest responsive and responsible base bid is considered fair and reasonable and within the district&#8217;s budget.  It is, therefore, recommended to approve award of an agreement to Oddrose Studio in the total base bid amount of $537,625 since from past experience the district has required the services of two firms to provide the necessary coverage.

<div class="itembody"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The district has determined it is in the best interests to terminate this agreement for convenience under Article 17 of the general conditions because the architect of record, HMC, incorrectly used an old Division of State Architect (DSA) application number for the ADA work. On May 9, 2008, general contractor Benold Construction was awarded the contract. If the termination of contract for convenience is approved, Benold&#8217;s last day of work will be on or about January 31, 2009. <br><br>The original scope of work for Marston Middle School included modernization work and a bid alternate for ADA improvements to the auditorium, with both pieces of the project approved by DSA under a single DSA file number. The modernization portion of the work was awarded as increment 1 on August 27, 2002, with the auditorium improvements reserved for a later date. Upon completion of increment 1 work, HMC closed out the project with DSA, including, inadvertently, the ADA auditorium improvement work which had not been performed. <br><br>Approximately two years later, the district decided to proceed with the ADA work in the auditorium and asked HMC to prepare a new bid package. HMC stated categorically that the design did not have to go back to DSA, and that the district could proceed under the previously approved DSA number that was obtained for both the modernization and ADA work. Based on these assurances from HMC, the district bid the project for the installation of ADA improvements to the auditorium at Marston and awarded the contract on May 9, 2008. The scope included new flooring, seating and exterior stair renovations. Benold proceeded on June 18, 2008, to remove the flooring and seating from the auditorium. <br><br>In the beginning of July 2008, it was discovered that the DSA number that HMC represented as valid was in fact closed and that the work had to cease in order to secure a new file number. The project has been on hold since July 16, 2008. The district has prepared and submitted the required paperwork to DSA and expects to receive approval of the drawings to construct the project by mid-December 2008. But DSA has required many changes to the original scope of work that now place the estimate to complete the project well beyond the original scope of work and over the 10 percent threshold for change orders, which necessitates the project being re-bid at a later date. Benold is in the process of restoring the flooring and seating to the auditorium so that it may be used while the district re-bids the project, and will be compensated for all work adequately performed as of the effective date of termination, which will be on or about January 31, 2009. </font><p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The district will seek from HMC reimbursement of costs it incurred, including amounts paid to Benold, due to HMC&#8217;s erroneous use of an outdated DSA application number. The original bid award amount was $627,400, of which $209,084.50 is due Benold for demolition and restoration work.

<div class="itembody"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">A request has been submitted by members of the Lincoln High School community to name the Lincoln High School Football Stadium after Vic Player, the Athletic Director at the school, from 1974-1999.  This effort has been spearheaded by community members-- Mr. Richard Miner and Ms. Debra Stephens, Chairperson of the Lincoln High School Naming Committee.  </font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In addition, a petition for this naming was created and circulated within the community by the Lincoln Hornet Booster Club.  Mel Collins, Executive Principal, Lincoln staff and former principal Wendell Bass have also endorsed this naming.  A Naming Committee meeting was convened in October 2008, comprised of students, a school board representative, community members and five Lincoln High School alumni. There was overwhelming community support.</font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Pursuant to Administrative Procedure 3300, Policy for Determining Availability of Schools, the School Names Committee is charged with reviewing requests by school communities and individuals regarding the naming of schools and facilities in the district. (See attached for the district School Names Committee roster.) An e-mail was sent to the committee on January 5, 2009, with background information regarding the naming request. Members were asked to submit an online vote; the committee voted unanimously to name the Lincoln High School Football Stadium after Vic Player, Athletic Director from 1974-1999.</font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">An article appeared in the </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Voice &amp; Viewpoint</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> newspaper on Thursday, October 23, 2008, announcing his death on October 15 at the age of 64.  Mr. Player was a teacher and coach for over 30 years and mentored such football greats as Marcus Allen, Akili Smith, and Terrell Davis. One former student called Vic Player a role model for all African American coaches. &#8220;The core values he taught me I&#8217;m teaching the players today because they still work.&#8221; </font><br><br><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Please note: </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">A letter was received from Vic Player on Janaury 28, 2007, giving his permission to use his name for the football stadium.  He thanked the district for considering him for such a great honor.</font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">There are no budget implications. The costs for the stadium signage has been fundraised through community donations. The location, scope and design of the signage will be approved by the district&#8217;s Architect Office. </font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">[Originator/Contact: Janet D.
