Tistadt, Chief Operating Officer, Facilities and Transportation Services	</font><br><br><b><font face="Arial">Meeting Type:	</font></b><font face="Arial">July 24, 2008 - Regular Meeting No. 2</font><br><br><b><font face="Arial">SUBJECT:	</font></b><font face="Arial">Purchase and Sale Agreement for 8111 Gatehouse Road </font><br><br><b><font face="Arial">TYPE:			</font></b><font face="Arial">Action</font><br><br><b><font face="Arial">BACKGROUND:</font></b><br><ul><ul><font face="Arial">On November 16, 2004, the School Board approved the consolidation of Fairfax County Public Schools administrative offices into a central campus in Merrifield.  Once completed, this action will combine approximately 1,700 personnel from twelve School Board-owned properties and five leased offices into a single campus. </font><br><br><font face="Arial">Phase I of the consolidation was completed in May 2006 with the acquisition of the existing campus properties at Jefferson Park consisting of one building (Gatehouse Administration Center I) with approximately 208,000 square feet, that houses approximately 650 staff members. In addition, an adjacent 3.13-acre parcel was acquired that is currently undeveloped and used for overflow parking. </font><br><br><font face="Arial">The debt service costs for Phase I of the consolidation are fully supported through savings achieved from the expiration of leases; efficiencies, expense, and staff reductions; and the avoidance of future renovation and major maintenance costs for those owned properties that became surplus and were transferred to Fairfax County as a result of the consolidation. This transaction benefited the school system&#8217;s capital program through an increase in capital funds resulting from the transfer of surplus properties to the County. These increased funds for the capital program have been and will be used only for the construction and renovation of schools. </font><br><br><font face="Arial">The second and final phase of the consolidation can be achieved with the acquisition of an approximately 275,000 square foot facility that is located at the Jefferson Park complex. The negotiated purchase price of the facility is $52 million, plus an amount up to $5 million to reimburse the Seller for certain documented renovations made by the seller to the property. In addition to these acquisition costs, the School Board is expected to finance approximately $53.1 million to renovate and furnish the facility. </font><br><br><font face="Arial">It is anticipated that the acquisition of this property will be funded initially by Bond Anticipation Notes, and then permanently financed over a 26.5-year period by bonds issued by the Economic Development Authority. Under the anticipated financing structure, the School Board will not begin paying debt service until FY2013. The debt service and building operating costs will be fully funded from savings from lease expirations, position reductions, and operational efficiencies as delineated in the attached business model.  These savings also will provide an additional $1 million per year, which can be used for instructional needs within the school system, or can be classified as overall expenditure savings.  </font></ul></ul><ul><ul><font face="Arial">The Purchase and Sale Agreement (PSA), upon execution, provides for a 60-day Due Diligence Period that will serve a variety of useful purposes. First of all, staff and technical specialists will have the opportunity to inspect and evaluate the physical property and all building systems. Equally important, this 60-day period will provide time for the public and other stakeholders to review and comment on the proposed transaction. Under the PSA, the School Board has the right to terminate the PSA for any reason during the 60-day Due Diligence Period and to receive a refund of the $500,000 deposit. Finally, the School Board&#8217;s obligations under the PSA are expressly contingent, among other things, upon action by the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in connection with the financing. </font></ul></ul><br><b><font face="Arial">KEY POINTS:		</font></b><br><ul><ul><font face="Arial">Debt Service costs will continue to be supported through operational savings, thus there will be no direct or indirect negative impact to the capital program. </font><br><br><font face="Arial">The size of the 8111 Gatehouse Road facility will enable the School Board to elect to vacate the following administrative facilities, which may thereafter be used for other functions: Devonshire Center, Dunn Loring Center, and Lacey Center.</font></ul></ul><br><b><font face="Arial">OPTIONS:		</font></b><br><br><font face="Arial">	None recommended.</font><br><br><b><font face="Arial">RECOMMENDATION:</font></b><br><ul><ul><font face="Arial">That the School Board 1.) authorize school system staff to negotiate a Purchase and Sale Agreement (PSA) with 8111 Gatehouse Investors, LLC, as seller, that will provide for the purchase of the real property and improvements located at 8111 Gatehouse Road, Merrifield, Virginia; the payment by the School Board of a $52 million purchase price and the reimbursement to seller for certain pre-closing renovation costs not to exceed $5 million; and such other provisions as are customary for such transactions and consistent with the terms presented in closed session; 2.) authorize the Chief Operating Officer to execute and deliver, after consultation with the School Board&#8217;s attorney, a PSA in substantial conformity with the foregoing; 3.) direct staff to engage the community and obtain feedback about the transaction and to report back to the School Board on September 18, 2008, with the results of the community engagement process and with a final recommendation.</font></ul></ul><br><b><font face="Arial">ATTACHMENTS:	</font></b><font face="Arial">1.

In a recent high school student survey 8.5 percent of 10,000 students admitted taking food without payment.  In the past five years, Food and Nutrition Services has piloted a variety of activities to reduce losses.  These included offering free meals to adults in return for lunch line supervision, limiting number of students entering service areas, and posters and public announcements designed by the Fairfax County Public Schools Student Advisory Council.  Despite these efforts student theft continues to rise.</font><br><br><font face="Arial">Safety and Security have researched the closed circuit TV technology and the monitors would be placed on each serving line and snack bar.  The monitors would be in plain view; students would see their image on the screen while moving through the lines. The images also would be recorded for review.  Cameras would be placed in the storerooms to record presence of unauthorized personnel.</font><br><br><font face="Arial">The purchase of the equipment and installation would be coordinated with Safety and Security to ensure compliance with procurement and maintenance standards.  The estimated $60,000 cost would be with Food and Nutrition Services funds. </font><br><br><font face="Arial">When cameras were installed in the school cafeterias in Brevard County, Florida and Duke University in North Carolina, the food service programs experienced an increase in revenue.</font></ul></ul><br><b><font face="Arial">RECOMMENDATION:</font></b><br><br><font face="Arial">	That the School Board amend Policy 7325, Video Surveillance, to permit a pilot for closed circuit TV technology and video recording at Annandale, Mount Vernon, and Westfield High 	Schools and Lake Braddock, Robinson, and South County Secondary Schools.</font><br><br><a href="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/867C79244BA3/$FILE/P7325.pdf"><img src="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/867C79244BA3/Body/0.1D1C?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="57" height="47" alt="P7325.pdf" border="0"></a><br></div>

These rules generally take effect on January 1, 2009.  They are the first comprehensive update in 40 years and will have significant impact on FCPS.  These regulations impose specific documentation and compliance obligations on plan sponsors well beyond previously defined responsibilities.  The administrative fees for the TPA services will be $2.00 per active participant per month and will be guaranteed at that amount for the initial three years of the contract.  The total amount of annual fees is estimated to run $185,000 and will be paid by employees and 403(b) vendors.

The Board concluded that 1) additional information was needed and that 2) the Board would take a formal vote on the scope for these studies at a regular Board meeting.  </font><br><br><font face="Arial">	The Board requested that modular capacity information provided in the initial staff report be consolidated in the capacity analysis table; that more schools be added to the capacity analysis provided for schools outside staff&#8217;s recommended scope of study; and that a clearer articulation of the basis for staff&#8217;s recommendation be provided. </font><br><font face="Arial">	</font><br><br><b><font face="Arial">KEY POINTS:	</font></b><br><br><font face="Arial">	The purpose of the fall studies is to establish elementary school attendance areas for these two elementary school sites that are under construction and scheduled to open in fall 2009.  Staff has</font><b><font face="Arial"> </font></b><font face="Arial">reviewed the surrounding elementary schools for both sites and provided an assessment of capacities, enrollments and projections.  In consideration of those schools which either need relief or could provide flexibility with regard to various options for new attendance areas, staff reaffirms the recommendation for the Fall 2008 Scope of Boundary Studies, as provided in the July 14, 2008, work session agenda package.  Changes to feeder school boundaries are not proposed.  Realignments to feeder schools may be considered in the future as part of a comprehensive study which would review transportation efficiencies, split feeders and attendance islands.</font><br><ul><ul><font face="Arial">The additional capacity analysis information requested by the Board is contained in the attached countywide capacity analysis.  Note: this analysis will be updated in the 2010-2014 CIP to include new 5-year projections.     </font><br></ul></ul><font face="Arial">	At the Board's July 18, 2008, retreat, there was a discussion about the selection criteria to consider for populating a new elementary school.  The consensus of the Board was to consider the following criteria:  reduce overcrowding in neighboring schools, geographic proximity, maximize stability of programs, accomodate current student enrollment, accomodate projected future enrollment, reduce boundary lines (e.g. islands), adhere to core capacity, provide socio-economic status and ESOL balance, respect man-made and natural barriers, school feeder assignments, minimize split neighborhoods, and minimize additional capital/operating costs.  </font><ul><ul></ul></ul><b><font face="Arial">OPTIONS:	</font></b><br><br><font face="Arial">	Modify staff recommendation to include other schools or exclude a recommended school(s). </font><br><br><br><b><font face="Arial">RECOMMENDATION:	</font></b><br><br><font face="Arial">	That the School Board approve the following:  1) criteria for boundary decisions, 2) the scope for the Fall 2008 Coppermine elementary school site boundary study, and 3)  the scope for the Fall 2008 Laurel Hill elementary school site boundary study, as detailed in the agenda item.</font><br><font face="Arial"> </font><br><br><br><font face="Arial">Attachments:  County-wide Capacity Analysis </font><a href="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/867C9A2451A0/$FILE/capacitybalance2008with2007.pdf"><img src="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/867C9A2451A0/Body/0.1F74?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="175" height="48" alt="capacitybalance2008with2007.pdf" border="0"></a><br><font face="Times New Roman"> </font><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><font face="Arial">2008 Scope of Boundary Studies &#8211; Coppermine ES and Laurel Hill ES</font><a href="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/867C9A2451A0/$FILE/2008ScopeofStudy.pdf"><img src="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/867C9A2451A0/Body/0.2D94?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="120" height="48" alt="2008ScopeofStudy.pdf" border="0"></a><br><font face="Arial">Appendix A Maps: Coppermine ES Scope of Study and Development Potential </font><a href="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/867C9A2451A0/$FILE/Coppermine%20Appendix%20A.pdf"><img src="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/867C9A2451A0/Body/0.39B0?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="144" height="48" alt="Coppermine Appendix A.pdf" border="0"></a><br><font face="Arial">Appendix B Maps: Laurel Hill ES Scope of Study and Development Potential</font><a href="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/867C9A2451A0/$FILE/Laurel%20Hill%20Appendix%20B.pdf"><img src="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/867C9A2451A0/Body/0.4616?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="132" height="48" alt="Laurel Hill Appendix B.pdf" border="0"></a><br></div>
