<p>
	<em><strong><span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;">WHEREAS</span></strong></em><span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;">, 65 percent of underage youth say they get alcohol from family and friends, even though it is illegal in Virginia for a person under 21 years of age to consume or possess alcohol, and it is illegal for an adult to provide alcohol to a person under 21 years of age; and </span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<em><strong><span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;">WHEREAS</span></strong></em><span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;">, alcohol is the most commonly used illegal drug by Fairfax County students; and underage alcohol use is associated with traffic crashes and fatalities, other drug use, violence and gang involvement, rape, depression and suicide, and educational failure; and</span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong><span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;"><em>WHEREAS</em>, </span></strong><span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;">the 2009 Fairfax County Youth Survey reported that 39 percent of high school seniors and almost 22 percent of tenth graders had consumed alcohol in the last 30 days, and that 23 percent of seniors had engaged in binge drinking in the last two weeks; and </span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<em><strong><span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;">WHEREAS</span></strong></em><span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;">, the Unified Prevention Coalition of Fairfax County Public Schools and its school-community coalitions have brought together concerned residents, school officials, county government agencies, and many community groups to address the underage drinking issue; and launched an educational and public awareness campaign in spring 2007 known as &ldquo;Parents Who Host, Lose the Most:&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be a party to teenage drinking,&rdquo; to educate parents and to increase awareness of and compliance with Virginia underage drinking laws; and </span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong><span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;"><em>WHEREAS</em>,</span></strong><span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;"> prevention efforts, including parents talking to their teens and modeling appropriate behavior, are critical, particularly during prom and graduation season; </span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<em><strong><span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;">NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED </span></strong></em><span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;">that the Fairfax County School Board supports the Unified Prevention Coalition and its Countywide Initiative to Reduce Underage Drinking and recognizes the month of May 2011 as &ldquo;Parents Who Host, Lose The Most&rdquo; month in Fairfax County.&nbsp; </span></p>

	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The winner of the 2011 Distinguished School Resource Officer award is Master Police Officer Ilsa Blaney, Jackson Middle School.</span></span></p>
<p>
	<br />
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Fairfax County Public Schools and the Fairfax County Police Department have established a mutually beneficial relationship for more than a decade. One of the hallmarks of this relationship has been the School Resource Officer (SRO) program. SROs help ensure a safe and peaceful learning environment for students, and provide school administrators and staff with the law enforcement resources and expertise necessary to maintain order, prevent truancy, and enforce the rules and codes of student conduct.<br />
	<br />
	A committee was created to establish and select the Distinguished School Resource Officer Award to annually recognize the efforts of outstanding SROs. &nbsp;The 2011 selection committee members are Fred Ellis, Director of the Office of Safety and Security, Phyllis Pajardo, Cluster II Assistant Superintendent, and Lieutenant Ken Baine, School Liaison Commander.<br />
	<br />
	There were a total of eight School Resource Officers nominated by their principals. These nominees are stellar examples of the outstanding officers working in our schools. They should be very proud of their nomination.<br />
	<br />
	The nominees were:<br />
	<br />

	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Key Points:</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Department of Special Services, as required by Public Law 108-446, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004, has completed the Local Special Education Annual Plan and Report 2011-2012.&nbsp; This report will be used by the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) in preparing the state plan for special education.&nbsp; Compared to prior year&rsquo;s reports, the 2011-12 report reflects a new requirement by VDOE to submit entirely online in a proscribed abbreviated format.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The 2011-2012 Section 611, Part B application estimates revenue to Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) of $32,700,991. This amount is equal to 2010-2011 award. Estimated expenditures include cost associated with maintaining a 15% set-aside for Coordinated Early Intervening Services (CEIS).&nbsp; Section 611, Part B, award will fund a total of 465 FTE positions.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The 2011-2012 Section 619, Part B Preschool application estimates revenue to FCPS of $791,234. This amount is equal to 2010-2011 award. &nbsp;These funds support Child Find activities as well as parenting and transition services for preschool-age students.&nbsp; Section 619 funds seven FTE positions.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The amounts above reflect no change from the 2010-2011 award.&nbsp; The 2011-2012 application reflects funding of the same programs funded in the 2010-2011 application.&nbsp; Small adjustments in both sections 611 and 619 have been made only for incumbent salaries, employee benefit costs, and the state restricted indirect cost rate.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Fairfax County Advisory Committee for Students with Disabilities (ACSD) reviewed the plan and funding application at its April 13, 2011 meeting.</span></span></p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">On February 3, 2011, the School Board adopted the FY 2012 Advertised Budget which included the following expenditure highlights:&nbsp; two percent market scale adjustment for employees; step increases for eligible employees; increases in salary lapse; retirement and health rate increases; contract length reductions; membership growth and demographic changes; online Standards of Learning (SOL) test requirements for elementary schools; high school needs-based staffing; and reductions related to one-time federal stimulus funding.</span></span></p>

	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Included in FCPS&rsquo; FY 2012 Advertised Budget was a request for increased funding from the county.&nbsp; The Board of Supervisors approved a level transfer from the county to the School Operating Fund resulting in a decrease of $48.8 million as compared to the request in the advertised budget.&nbsp; As a result of the impacts of the county budget, state budget, and other updates, additional adjustments are required.&nbsp; Details are provided on the attached agenda.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
