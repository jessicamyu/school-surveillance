	<span style="font-family:arial,sans-serif;">Laura Ashley Piper served as student representative to the Fairfax County School Board from 1986 to 1987. This outstanding student, talented athlete, and exceptional leader graduated from Robinson Secondary School and the Air Force Academy and was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the Air Force. She was killed in action over northern Iraq in April 1994. To honor Laura Ashley Piper&rsquo;s strong commitment to student participation and to recognize her high standards of achievement and involvement and her willingness to continually accept responsibility throughout her lifetime, the School Board of Fairfax County has established the annual $1,000 Laura Ashley Piper Scholarship.&nbsp; In 2007, Apple Federal Credit Union Education Foundation began its endowment of the Laura Ashley Piper Scholarship, providing $1,000 annually.&nbsp; We appreciate their continued generosity. </span></p>

<p>
	<span style="font-family:arial,sans-serif;">Each year, every high school may nominate one senior student who exemplifies the &ldquo;attributes of personal excellence and commitment to student government&rdquo; of Lt. Piper. A committee from the Office of School Counseling Services, Department of Instructional Services, considers the nominees. There is an engraved plaque in the School Board Office with each winner&rsquo;s name.</span></p>

	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The School Board Character Award was initiated by former Student Representative to the School Board Chris Giovarelli and established by the Student Advisory Council in 2001. In 2007, Apple Federal Credit Union Education Foundation began funding a $500 award for the winner.&nbsp; The award is given to a junior or senior, who demonstrates a continuous record of high morals, strong integrity, and good character, and who is recognized as a role model for other Fairfax County Public Schools students in day-to-day behavior.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Kathryn J. Muir is the recipient of the 2011 School Board Character Award, chosen from a pool of outstanding nominees.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">As president of her senior class at Chantilly High School, Kathryn initiated the &ldquo;11 for 11&rdquo; Community Service Projects. &ldquo;11 for 11&rdquo; challenged members of her senior class to get involved in their community by participating in eleven service projects before graduation.&nbsp; She helped organize and lead many service projects, like promoting literacy at a local homeless shelter, assisting at an annual holiday function for families and children affected by childhood cancer, partnering with a local elementary school to lead a Just Say No club, and holding a track-a-thon to raise awareness and funds for the National Brain Tumor Association, which, incidentally, raised over $7,000.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">She has also volunteered as an assistant coach for the Girls on the Run program, where she was a mentor and leader to many young girls; chosen by the leadership at her school, she was an influential spokesperson for the school&rsquo;s character education lessons; and she has touched the lives of many people through her participation in fundraising events for National Brain Tumor Society.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Kathryn&rsquo;s positive attitude, genuine enthusiasm, and ability to work well with others have made her a strong leader among her fellow students.&nbsp; She was elected by her peers at Virginia Girls State to serve as a delegate. After working with other attendees, she introduced a bill to combat Cyber Bullying. This bill was passed by the Governor of Girls State.&nbsp; Kathryn continuously has served as an elected class officer, working hard to represent her class and school and earning the respect of not only her peers but also the adults she works with. </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">As one nominator wrote, &ldquo;Sometimes we are blessed with the opportunity to watch the future unfold.&nbsp; This student is humble of her abilities to balance school with athletics, community service, leadership, and relationships. She is never one to toot her own horn, instead choosing to highlight the strengths of others. &rdquo;&nbsp; Kathryn is a true leader and has demonstrated the qualities and leadership envisioned by SAC and Mr. Giovarelli when they established this award.</span></span></p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">SR&amp;R 2011-12 Updates</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">There&nbsp;have been numerous&nbsp;changes made&nbsp;in updating the 2011-2012 SR&amp;R, all of which&nbsp;are delineated&nbsp;in the&nbsp;Regulation, under item II. &quot;Summary of Changes since Last Publication.&quot;</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In addition, the strikethrough version which has been&nbsp;included here is the same as the one previously posted with the exception of the word &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; being changed to &ldquo;relevant&rdquo; on page 31. This was done&nbsp;in order to match the language in the SR&amp;R with the language in the new Special Education Procedures guide.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Recommendation:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">That the School Board adopt Regulation 2601.25P, Student Responsibilities and Rights (SR&amp;R), as detailed in the agenda item.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><strong>Proposed Amendments: </strong></u></span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I move to amend the main motion by renaming Regulation 2601 from Student Responsibilities and Rights to Student Rights and Responsibilities, effective August 1, 2011; further move that all references to Student Responsibilities and Rights in any corresponding policies, regulations, forms, or websites shall be changed to Student Rights and Responsibilities. (Hone)</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I move to amend the main motion by adding the following language to Chapter II, Section A, after the fourth paragraph on page 16:&nbsp; &ldquo;Before a student is removed from his or her base school and reassigned to another school or learning center, other disciplinary options will be considered, such as loss of privileges, community service, after school detention, or Saturday School.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Hone)</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I move to amend the main motion by adding the following language to Chapter II, Section A, after the fourth paragraph on page 16:&nbsp; &ldquo;When a student is subject to out-of-school suspension, the school system shall provide academic support and other services necessary for the student to maintain his or her academic progress.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Hone)</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I move to amend the main motion by adding the following language to Chapter II, Section A, after the fourth paragraph on page 16:&nbsp; &ldquo;When a student is subject to discipline, every effort shall be made to ensure that any special circumstance related to the timing of the violation is considered, including loss of scholarships or other academic or career opportunities, the loss of which could irreparably damage a student&#39;s long term academic options and life chances.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Hone)</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I move to amend the main motion by revising Chapter II, Section C.6.b.(1), on page 31, by deleting the following sentence:&nbsp; &ldquo;Relevant members of the IEP team shall determine, pursuant to special education procedures, whether or not the misconduct is a manifestation of the student&#39;s disability.&rdquo; and inserting the following sentence:&nbsp; &ldquo;FCPS, the parents and relevant members of the child&rsquo;s IEP team (as determined by the parent and FCPS) shall determine the conduct to be a manifestation of the child&#39;s disability (a) if the conduct in question was caused by, or had a direct and substantial relationship to, the child&#39;s disability; or (b)if the conduct in question was the direct result of the school division&rsquo;s failure to implement the child&rsquo;s IEP.&rdquo;&nbsp;(Center)</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I move to amend the main motion by adding the following language to the end of Chapter II, Section C.2.d.(3) on page 29 and Section C.4.a. on page 30:&nbsp; &ldquo;A parent or guardian may request that a discipline hearing be transcribed by a court reporter. The transcription must be requested at the time the hearing is scheduled, and arrangements will be made by the Superintendent&rsquo;s Hearing Office for transcription as well as redaction of confidential information.&nbsp; The cost of transcription is at the parent or guardian&rsquo;s expense, and a hearing may not be delayed on account of such a request.&rdquo; (Moon)</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I move to amend the main motion by inserting the following language to Chapter II, Section C, on page 26 after the third sentence:&nbsp; &ldquo;In the event that school officials believe the student has committed an offense for which a report to law enforcement is required*, school officials shall notify the student&rsquo;s parent or guardian prior to questioning of the student by school officials or a school resource officer unless there is an immediate danger to others.&nbsp; *Note:&nbsp; Such offenses are specified in Section 22.1-279.3:1 of the Code of Virginia and include all prohibited substance and illegal drug violations, unauthorized use or possession of any weapon or explosive device (including a hoax explosive device), arson, assault, assault and battery with bodily injury, sexual assault, stalking, bomb threats, threats against school personnel on school property or at school-sponsored activities, and theft or attempted theft of student prescription drugs.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Moon/Evans)</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><em>Clerk&rsquo;s note:&nbsp; The current sentence &ldquo;Parents or guardians seeking information on the hearing process should contact the Hearings Office (571-423-1280).&rdquo; would become the start of a second paragraph in Section C.&nbsp; </em></span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I move to amend the main motion by adding the following sentence at the end of the first paragraph of Chapter II, Section C, on page 26:&nbsp; &ldquo;Students suspected of such offenses may not be asked, told, or otherwise encouraged to sign any statement before the parent or guardian is notified and given an opportunity to be present or to speak to the student.&rdquo; (Moon/Evans)</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I move to amend the amendment by inserting the words &ldquo;write or&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;sign&rdquo;, resulting in the following sentence:&nbsp; &ldquo;Students suspected of such offenses may not be asked, told, or otherwise encouraged to write or sign any statement before the parent or guardian is notified and given an opportunity to be present or to speak to the student.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Evans)</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">10.&nbsp; I move to amend the main motion by adding the following new paragraph to Chapter II, Section C, on page 26:&nbsp; &ldquo;In cases where school officials believe a student has committed an offense for which a report to law enforcement is required, the student shall be informed of his/her right to remain silent and to not self-incriminate and will be given an opportunity to attempt to contact his/her parent or guardian before questioning.&rdquo; (Evans)</span></span></p>

	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Key Points:</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Virginia School Boards Association (VSBA) annually solicits input from local school boards for changes to the Virginia School Boards Association Legislative Positions.&nbsp; Recommendations for changes to VSBA positions are based on those already adopted by the Fairfax County School Board (FCSB) for its own 2011 Fairfax County School Board Legislative Program.&nbsp; The FCSB Legislative Program itself will be updated&nbsp; in fall 2011 in advance of the 2012 Virginia General Assembly session.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The School Board held a Legislative work session on May 16, 2011,&nbsp; to consider proposed recommendations to VSBA.&nbsp; In addition to its legislative recommendations, the Board recommended that the cover letter to VSBA (that will accompany its proposed legislative language changes) express the FCSB support for the existing VSBA legislative position regarding comprehensive study of the Local Composite Index (VSBA Position 9.6 Composite Index) and its opposition to a proposal that would allow some jurisdictions to assess their local true property values at something other than fair value.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Recommendation:</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">That the School Board accept the legislative recommendations to be forwarded to the </span></span><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Virginia School Boards Association</span></span><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> Legislative, Policies and Resolutions Committee for their consideration, as detailed in the agenda item. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Funding for this project will be provided by the major maintenance field lighting fund.&nbsp; A Selection Advisory Committee (SAC) received three proposals from pre-qualified sports field lighting firms on April 26, 2011. The SAC evaluated the proposals and ranked the firms in accordance with the criteria set forth in the Request for Proposal (RFP). The SAC negotiated a price with the top-ranked firm, which was found to be clearly more highly qualified than the others responding to the RFP for this project. </span></span></p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Related To:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Administrative Clarification and Legal Requirement</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Key Points:</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">The ERFC Board of Trustees is recommending technical amendments to the ERFC Defined Benefit Plan (<em>ERFC </em>and <em>ERFC 2001) </em>for the purpose of clarifying the designation of beneficiaries, clarifying the appeals process and complying with recent IRS guidance with respect to investing in group trusts.&nbsp; None of the proposed changes are expected to affect the benefits payable under the Plan.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Designation of Beneficiaries:&nbsp; </strong>The current plan documents permit only individuals and trusts to be named as beneficiaries to receive benefits after the member&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; Members have inquired about designating charities to receive a refund of the member&rsquo;s accumulated contributions, and other retirement plans also permit companies to be named. The Trustees recommend that <em>ERFC</em> and <em>ERFC-2001</em> documents be amended to clarify that members can name a charity or a company to receive contribution refunds upon a member&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Appeals:&nbsp; </strong>The current plan documents authorize an appeal to the Board of Trustees when a benefit application has been denied. Both <em>ERFC</em> and <em>ERFC 2001</em> should be amended to clarify that if a member or other person seeking a benefit chooses to make a personal appearance in support of an appeal to the Board that appearance occurs when the appeal is first presented to the Board.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Legal Compliance. </strong>The IRS recently issued Revenue Ruling 2011-1.&nbsp; The Revenue Ruling allows additional types of retirement plans to invest in a group trust without jeopardizing the tax status of the plans, places additional restrictions on such investment arrangements, and requires that these new rules be stated in the plan document of any plan that invests in a group trust.&nbsp; The Trustees have found such group trusts to be economical way to make certain types of investments, and recommend that <em>ERFC</em> and <em>ERFC 2001</em> be amended to conform to the Revenue Ruling.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Recommendation:</strong>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">That the School Board approve Amendment 1 to <em>ERFC</em> and <em>ERFC 2001</em> for the purposes of: (1) allowing members to name additional types of beneficiaries to receive refunds of contributions; (2) clarifying the appeals process;&nbsp; (3) complying with recent IRS guidance with respect to investing in group trusts.</span></span></p>
