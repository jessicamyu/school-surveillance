	<br />
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Fairfax County Public Schools and the Fairfax County and Fairfax City Police Departments have established a mutually beneficial relationship for more than a decade. One of the hallmarks of this relationship has been the School Resource Officer (SRO) program.

	<br />
	A committee was created to establish and select the Distinguished School Resource Officer Award to annually recognize the efforts of outstanding SROs. &nbsp;The 2014 selection committee members were Fred Ellis, Director of the Office of Safety and Security, Marty Smith, Cluster 1 Assistant Superintendent, and Lieutenant Christian Quinn, School Liaison Commander.<br />
	<br />
	Two other School Resource Officers were nominated by their principals. These nominees are stellar examples of the outstanding officers working in our schools. They should be very proud of their nomination.</span></span></p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Key Points:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The Board of Supervisors recently adopted a refinancing plan for the 2005 transaction by which the School Board arranged original financing of the lease/purchase and improvement of the Gatehouse Administrative Center and associated real estate (collectively, the &ldquo;Gatehouse Project&rdquo;).</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">In the 2005 transaction, the Fairfax County Economic Development Authority (&ldquo;EDA&rdquo;) issued facility revenue bonds to finance the acquisition and sold the Gatehouse Project to Fairfax County which, in turn, leased the Gatehouse Project to the School Board pursuant to the terms of the County/School Board lease agreement (the &ldquo;Lease Agreement&rdquo;). This Lease Agreement requires the School Board to make rental payments from its operating budget to the County in amounts that equal the payments due from the County to the EDA (for the principal and interest payable by EDA on the 2005 facility revenue bonds). </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The County&rsquo;s refinancing plan involves the EDA issuing refunding bonds, in all likelihood on or before June 26, 2014, in order to achieve debt service savings. This savings will reduce the rental payments due from the School Board to the County pursuant to the Lease Agreement, and the Lease Agreement will be amended accordingly to reflect the new, lower rental amount, following the issuance of the refunding bonds.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The Board of Supervisors and the EDA previously approved this refinancing on May 13, 2014, and May 20, 2014, respectively.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Recommendation:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">That</span></span><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"> the School Board (i) adopt a Resolution approving the 2014 refinancing plan for the Gatehouse Project, as detailed in the agenda item; (ii) authorize the Chairman or Vice Chairman, with the advice of legal counsel for the school division, to negotiate, execute and administer a School Board Tax Certificate and all other documents as are deemed appropriate and advisable, and to do all things necessary to complete the transaction contemplated by the Resolution.</span></span></p>

<p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The ERFC Board of Trustees is recommending a technical amendment to the ERFC Defined Benefit Plan (ERFC and ERFC 2001) for the purpose of deleting the reference to &quot;GASB&quot; in the requirement for amortization of the unfunded liability in ERFC&#39;s funding policy.&nbsp; Under the new GASB Statements 67 and 68, the accounting and funding measures are disconnected and the funding policy should not reference GASB. The proposed change does not affect the benefits payable under the Plan.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Funding Policy - General Financial Objective and Employer&nbsp;Contributions:</strong>&nbsp; The current Plan document contains a funding policy for the Plan&nbsp;which states that the objective shall be &quot;to establish and receive contributions which will remain approximately level from generation to generation of citizens and which, when combined with other assets and investment return, will be sufficient to pay benefits when due, while providing a reasonable margin for adverse experience.&quot;&nbsp; The policy further states that the Trustees and the actuary should determine reasonable assumptions regarding future experience.&nbsp; The final criterion states that any unfunded accrued liabilities shall be amortized over a period not to exceed 30 years, in accordance with GASB requirements.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">GASB has stated that &quot;it is not within the scope of the Board&#39;s activities to set standards that establish specific methods of financing the benefits (that being a policy decision for government officials...)&quot; Therefore, actuarial standards of practice that apply to public sector plans should govern the establishment of the amortization period for unfunded liabilities rather than GASB.&nbsp; The ERFC Board of Trustees, in conjunction with its actuary, has established a remaining amortization period of 25 years in the December 31, 2013 valuation.&nbsp; The Board intends to decrease the amortization period annually until the Plan is 100 percent funded.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Recommendation</strong>:&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">That the School Board approve Amendment 4 to <em>ERFC</em> and <em>ERFC 2001 </em>for the purpose of deleting the reference to the GASB requirement for amortization of the unfunded liabilities.</span></span></p>
