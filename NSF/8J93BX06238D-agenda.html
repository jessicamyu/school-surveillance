But it&rsquo;s just as important to keep our students safe the next morning, when they have stayed up all night without sleep and shouldn&rsquo;t be driving.&nbsp; Parents, please pick up your students from these events or arrange for another well-rested person to do so. Drowsy driving, like driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, is &quot;impaired&rdquo; driving. &nbsp;We want our graduates to celebrate, enjoy the party, and arrive home safely in the morning.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The School Board Character Award was initiated by former Student Representative to the School Board Chris Giovarelli and established by the Student Advisory Council in 2001. In 2007, Apple Federal Credit Union Education Foundation began funding a $500 award for the winner.&nbsp; The award is given to a junior or senior, who demonstrates a continuous record of high morals, strong integrity, and good character, and who is recognized as a role model for other Fairfax County Public Schools students in day-to-day behavior.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Juan C. Castro is the recipient of the 2012 School Board Character Award, chosen from a pool of outstanding nominees.</span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Humble.&nbsp; Polite.&nbsp; Hard Working. Selfless. Compassionate. These are just a few of the many words used to describe Juan.&nbsp; Juan is a senior at Westfield High School and an outstanding student, maintaining good grades while working a job and actively volunteering in his school and community.&nbsp; To quote from one of his recommendations: &ldquo;He consistently demonstrates good character, high morals, and strong integrity by giving of himself and what he has as well as by rejoicing in the happiness of others.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">He is a former ESOL student, who befriends and mentors countless ESOL students new to the country and the school system, helping them with translations, motivating them to work hard and to excel in their studies.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He connects with all of the students and exhibits patience and humor immediately putting them at ease.&nbsp; This role is one he voluntarily took on because he wanted to help other students achieve success. He is truly an inspiration to students who often feel discouraged by the challenges of learning English and adapting to life in the United States.</span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Two years ago, Juan founded the EDGE Club at Westfield High School, a bible study club that meets regularly, sometimes with a guest speaker, all organized under Juan&rsquo;s leadership.&nbsp; He is also a mentor with the Hispanic Student Success Council, where he meets with students struggling in their classes and helps them stay motivated.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">One of Juan&rsquo;s teachers described him as having an infectious laugh and the ability to move across and within social and cultural groups, having friends from all walks of life. On his application, Juan mentioned the following quote: &ldquo;We enter to learn and get out to serve.&rdquo;&nbsp; Juan exemplifies that in his personal and school life and is most deserving of this honor.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">I move that the School Board establish a special committee of the Board to perform a comprehensive review of the Fairfax County Public Schools&rsquo; Student Rights and Responsibilities (SR&amp;R), and those manuals of other school districts, to recommend changes to the School Board by March 2013 that would simplify the language and substantially reduce the size of SR&amp;R and ensure consistency with our community&rsquo;s values, School Board policies, and Virginia laws.&nbsp; This committee shall be composed of representatives of parents, students, school administrators, teachers, student specialists (e.g., counselors, social workers, psychologists, hearings officers or SROs), juvenile services specialists and/or such other community members as the School Board shall determine appropriate.</span></span></p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">I move to postpone Board consideration on amendments to SR&amp;R until the Board receives recommendations from the newly established special committee reviewing SR&amp;R by March 2013.</span></span></p>
<p>

<p>
	<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">3.&nbsp; <strong>Ilryong Moon</strong>:</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">I move to amend the main motion by adding the following language to Chapter II, Section C., Disciplinary Procedures, page 27, at the end of the paragraph:&nbsp; &ldquo;Notwithstanding any other provision of SR&amp;R, the principal shall have the right to permit a student who has appealed a short-term suspension or a recommendation for more serious disciplinary action, or both, to remain in school while such appeal is pending before school officials, provided that the principal determines in his sole judgment that the student would not pose a danger to persons or property or an ongoing threat of disruption of the school&rsquo;s educational programs. The foregoing permission is subject to review and revocation at any time by the principal, Division Superintendent, or School Board.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">4.&nbsp; <strong>Elizabeth Schultz (3):</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">I move to amend the main motion by revising Chapter II, Section C., Disciplinary Procedures, page 27, by striking the third sentence &ldquo;The principal will make a reasonable effort to notify parents or guardians at the earliest opportunity regarding student disciplinary actions.&rdquo; and inserting the following language:&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">&ldquo;Except under exigent circumstances, the principal or his administrative designee shall notify parents or guardians of any student suspected of committing a serious violation of School Board policy. </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">In cases where a serious violation, as set forth in this section, necessitates the questioning of any student, the principal or his administrative designee may only question a student, except under exigent circumstances, after the student&rsquo;s parents have been notified.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">For purposes of this section, a &quot;serious violation&quot; means a violation of a School Board policy or compulsory school attendance requirements when such violation could result in</span></span></p>

	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">the student&#39;s suspension or expulsion; </span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp; the notification of law enforcement; or </span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp; the filing of a court petition, whether or not the school administration has imposed such disciplinary action or filed a petition.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">I move the following amendment in the form of a substitute motion:&nbsp; I move to amend the main motion by adding the following language to Chapter II, Section C., Disciplinary Procedures, page 27, before the sentence &ldquo;Parents and guardians seeking information on the hearing process should contact the Hearings Office&rdquo;:&nbsp; &ldquo;Under no circumstances shall the principal or his administrative designee ask or compel any written statement or signature on a document from any student without the consent of a parent or guardian.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">I move to amend the main motion by adding the following language to Chapter II, Section C., Disciplinary Procedures, page 27 before the sentence &ldquo;Parents and guardians seeking information on the hearing process should contact the Hearings Office&rdquo;:&nbsp; &ldquo;If a student elects to remain silent, the student shall not be deemed to be uncooperative.&rdquo;&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">In the event the Division Superintendent finds special circumstances on the written record, the student shall receive the following: mandatory assignment to FCPS&rsquo; five day Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) Intervention Seminar as part of the original ten days suspension; suspension for 30 calendar days from all student activities, including teams, clubs and all other school-sponsored activities; and probationary conditions.&nbsp; The days of absence from school shall be excused, and make-up work shall be provided by the school during the period of suspension if the student successfully completes the AOD Intervention Seminar and any other condition (including a drug screen and assessment) within 30 days.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">In the event the Division Superintendent does not find special circumstances following the written record review, the Superintendent shall hold a hearing to determine what disciplinary action, if any, should be imposed, subject to any right the student may have under this Regulation to appeal to the School Board.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">According to the Fairfax County Ordinance, Chapter 3, Section 3-4-3, the ERFC Board of Trustees consist of seven (7) persons, one of whom is referred to as the &ldquo;individual Trustee.&rdquo;&nbsp; The individual Trustee may not be affiliated with or employed by Fairfax&nbsp;County, the Fairfax County School Board, or any union or similar organization which represents teachers or other employees in Fairfax County.&nbsp; The individual Trustee is chosen by unanimous vote or consent of the other six trustees subject to the approval of the Fairfax County School Board, on the basis of the fact that such individual Trustee possesses competent financial and/or investment counseling skills.</span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">At a recent meeting of the ERFC Board of Trustees, Nitin Chittal, the Chief Executive Officer of KRA Capital Management, Inc., was unanimously recommended for reappointment as the &ldquo;individual Trustee.&rdquo;&nbsp; If approved by the School Board, Mr. Chittal will serve for a ninth consecutive year.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Key Points:</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">During the 2012 session of the Virginia General Assembly, legislation was passed requiring all active participants of the Virginia Retirement System (VRS) to contribute toward the cost of retirement benefits.&nbsp; The legislation provides that localities and school systems may phase in employee contributions at a rate of 1% or more per year, and that the full phase in of a 5% contribution rate must be completed by July 1, 2016.&nbsp; Jurisdictions must provide corresponding increases to salaries to offset these employee contributions. Newly hired or rehired employees as of July 1, 2012, shall pay 5% of their salary immediately and shall not have their contributions phased in.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">At the May 24, 2012, regular business meeting of the Fairfax County School Board, the Board adopted a 2% employee contribution rate for current employees for Fiscal Year 2013.&nbsp; VRS requires all participating employers to execute the attached resolution documenting the agreed upon employee contribution rates.&nbsp; While future year contribution rates may be adjusted upwards, the remainder of the resolution is binding and irrevocable. </span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The current version of Policy 1710 establishes nine standing citizen advisory committees to the School Board, setting forth their authority, responsibility, and representation.

<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Background:</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The initial &lsquo;charter&rsquo; for the Facilities Planning Advisory Council (FPAC) was in the form of a proposal put forth by the Comprehensive Planning Development Committee (CPDC).&nbsp; The proposal was accepted and FPAC was established with the first slate of appointed representatives in September 2010.&nbsp; Since that time, School Board Policy 1710, Citizen Advisory Committees to the School Board, has been amended to establish a process for replacing FPAC members and stipulating that the term of appointment to FPAC is three years, instead of the staggered terms of 1, 2, and 3 years as initially required under the FPAC proposal.&nbsp; The mission of the advisory council remains unchanged - to advise and inform the staff and School Board in the development of comprehensive, long term plans for facilities needs in the most effective and efficient way. &nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Key Points:</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The&nbsp; charter, as revised by CPDC, reflects the policy changes on terms of appointment and the practices that have evolved in the initial two years of FPAC&rsquo;s existence, including:</span></span></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">the process for referral of projects to FPAC</span></span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">modifying the Work Products section to include the annual charge from the School Board to FPAC</span></span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">clarify that attendance is expected at 75% of <strong><em><u>regular</u></em></strong> business meetings to sign on FPAC&rsquo;s annual report to the School Board</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Other revisions are minor and editorial in nature to simplify the document, such as:&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">removal of the complex communication flow charts</span></span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">re-ordering of text to improve flow and document organization</span></span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">text changes to eliminate redundancies</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Recommendation:</strong></span></span></p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Subject:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Fairfax Ridge - Additional Office Space Lease</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>School Board Action Required:&nbsp; </strong>Information</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Key Points:</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">A critical need for additional program, training and office space exists at Fairfax Ridge which would support the needs of the:</span></span></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Office Training Procedures (OTP) Student Program</span></span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Professional Learning Training Center</span></span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Department of Professional Learning and Accountability&rsquo;s Office of Program Evaluation</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">During the program and building consolidation in FY 2010, portions of four departments (Instructional Services, Special Services, Professional Learning and Accountability and Information Technology) were co-located to Fairfax Ridge primarily in order to return two facility sites (Lacey Center and Devonshire Center) into school use and further consolidate department programming.&nbsp; Approximately 430 staff were relocated to Fairfax Ridge at that time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Fairfax Ridge currently houses over 450 staff and hosts hundreds of training events with thousands of participants a year. &nbsp;The increase is primarily attributed to additional program grants and staff re-alignments from other admin centers for better control and accountability.&nbsp; The current inventory of meeting rooms is insufficient to accommodate all the demands for training, program and community events.&nbsp; Classroom storage space for the OTP student program is also insufficient to store program materials.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The proposed new lease would remedy the space shortages at Fairfax Ridge.&nbsp; There would be no fiscal impact in FY 2013 as existing resources would be used to offset the first-year lease costs.&nbsp; The new lease would have the same economic terms and conditions as the existing lease which is currently 12.8 percent below current market rates.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The following table depicts the material terms of the proposed lease relative to the existing FCPS lease at Fairfax Ridge:</span></span></p>
