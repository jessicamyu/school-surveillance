Tistadt, Chief Operating Officer, Facilities and Transportation Services	</font><br><br><b><font face="Arial">Meeting Type:	</font></b><font face="Arial">May 12, 2008 - Work Session No. 98</font><br><b><font face="Arial">		</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial">SUBJECT:	</font></b><font face="Arial">Approval of Agreement  &#8211; Junior Achievement Finance Park   </font><br><br><b><font face="Arial">TYPE:			</font></b><font face="Arial">Discussion</font><br><br><b><font face="Arial">BACKGROUND:	</font></b><br><ul><ul><font face="Arial">Junior Achievement (JA) is a non-profit group which promotes economic and financial literacy education through business partnerships and curriculum programs.  A Capstone Program called Finance Park which is targeted for a middle school audience consists of 26 forty-five minute lessons on personal financial literacy, supported by teacher instruction and student workbooks.  This program culminates in a field trip to an interactive site where students apply the knowledge and skills they have learned in the classroom.  When students arrive at the Finance Park site, they become &#8220;an adult for the day.&#8221;  The students are given an identity card with a description of a person's personal life: their marital status, children, income and occupation.  Students are then faced with making decisions regarding household expenses.  The goal is for them to develop a balanced budget.  </font><br><font face="Times New Roman"> </font><br><font face="Arial">The Finance Park site is divided into stations which represent the various components of a household budget such as utilities, savings, entertainment, housing, automobiles, etc.  At each station, there is a computer in which students will gather information about the related expenses and later enter their own information based upon the decisions they have made.  At the end of the experience, students receive a printout with their budget.  </font><br><font face="Times New Roman"> </font><br><font face="Arial">FCPS has had access to this interactive site which is presently a mobile unit located on the grounds of Capital One headquarters in McLean.  In fall 2006, eighth grade students from Rocky Run Middle School participated in a pilot of this program.  Since then the mobile unit has been brought back to the area and students from the summer school program for civics (summer 2007), and six additional middle schools have participated in the program and visited the Finance Park mobile unit.  The overall response from participation in this interactive program has been positive by all involved: students, parents, and teachers.  </font></ul></ul><ul><ul><font face="Arial">The Washington Capital Region of Junior Achievement is now proposing a long term partnership with FCPS to build a permanent structure that would house this program and allow all eighth grade students in FCPS to take part in this personal financial literacy curriculum.  Forming this partnership would facilitate all of our middle school students meeting many of the Economics Education and Financial Literacy Objectives required by Virginia Department of Education in April 2006. </font><br><br><b><font face="Arial">Estimated annual expenses for implementation of JA Finance Park include the following:</font></b><br><br><table width="100%" border="1"><tr valign="top"><td width="61%"><font face="Arial">Student fee ($20 per student X 11,500 students)</font></td><td width="39%"><font face="Arial">$ 230,000</font></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="61%"><font face="Arial">One resource teacher (218-day contract to facilitate training, scheduling, curriculum implementation)	</font></td><td width="39%"><font face="Arial">$   80,055</font></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="61%"><font face="Arial">Substitutes (4 per school x $125; will vary according to the needs</font><br><font face="Arial">of the school)	</font></td><td width="39%"><font face="Arial">$   13,500</font></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="61%"><font face="Arial">Teacher training stipend (approx 250 teachers -- grade 8 civics,</font><br><font face="Arial">250 grade 8 mathematics and Algebra teachers X $100)</font></td><td width="39%"><font face="Arial">$   50,000</font></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="61%"><font face="Arial">Student transportation	</font></td><td width="39%"><font face="Arial">$   88,220</font></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="61%"><font face="Arial">Facility maintenance and operations (includes utilities, grounds,</font><br><font face="Arial">major maintenance/infrastructure replacement, custodial, insurance)</font></td><td width="39%"><u><font face="Arial">$   84,900</font></u></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="61%"><b><font face="Arial">Total	</font></b></td><td width="39%"><b><font face="Arial">$ 546,775</font></b></td></tr></table><font face="Arial">In addition to the costs outlined above, FCPS will lease to JA, for one dollar ($1) per year, a parcel of property on the grounds of the Woodson/Frost campus upon which JA will construct a facility to house the Finance Park program operations. While there is virtually no initial cost to FCPS for the facility, per the agreement with JA, FCPS will fund all ongoing operations and maintenance costs to support the facility. Moreover, should it be determined that termination of the agreement with JA is in the best interest of the School Board, we would be obligated to purchase the facility for its then fair market value. </font><br><br><font face="Arial">The agreement between FCPS and JA will establish an initial fifteen (15) year period; four (4) additional five (5) year periods are available should we mutually agree to continue the program after the initial period. </font></ul></ul><br><b><font face="Arial">RECOMMENDATION:</font></b><ul><ul><ul><ul></ul></ul><font face="Arial">That the School Board authorize the execution of the documents between the Fairfax County School Board and the Washington Capital Region of Junior Achievement and authorize the Division Superintendent, or his designee, to execute the documents on behalf of the School Board. </font><br></ul></ul><font face="Arial">			</font><font size="4"> </font><br></div>

In a January 2007 report to the School Board, the task force opined that the school should include a Community School component and remain at the Graham Road facility if the school system was able to expand the current site size (only 4.6 acres).  Based upon this finding, significant efforts were made to acquire additional property adjacent to the site; however; we were not successful.  </font><br><br><font face="Arial">In winter 2008, the task force reconvened and reconsidered the issues based upon current information to include our inability to expand the Graham Road site.</font><br><br><font face="Arial">Copies of both task force reports are attached.</font><br></ul></ul><br><b><font face="Arial">KEY POINTS:</font></b><br><ul><ul><font face="Arial">There are good reasons to keep the school at the Graham Road site and there are good reasons to relocate the school to the Devonshire site.  Some highlights include:</font><br><ul><ul><ul type="disc"><li><font face="Arial">The relative costs of renovating the two sites are roughly equal; however, the total cost could be significant if we do not acquire a second building at the Gatehouse campus and the ultimate decision is to house community programs.  If we decide to locate the elementary school on the Devonshire site, it will be necessary to relocate the existing occupants and programs in that building during the renovation period; this will be expensive (approximately $1 million per year). One option for relocating Devonshire occupants is to acquire a second building at our Gatehouse campus. If we do not acquire a second building at our Gatehouse campus another option is to move the current Devonshire occupants and programs into the Graham Road facility after the Devonshire renovation. This would require that we spend additional monies to make the facility suitable; however, the scope and cost of such work are unknown at this time.</font></ul></ul></ul><br><ul><ul><ul type="disc"><li><font face="Arial">The majority of Graham Road ES students live in the Kingsley Commons community and walk to the school; these students will have to be bused to Devonshire.<br></font><li><font face="Arial">The renovated Graham Road site will not be large enough to house all existing instructional programs and require offsite 	movement of FECEP instructional programming.<br></font><li><font face="Arial">The Devonshire site is about 8 acres versus only 4.6 acres at Graham Road, the smallest FCPS elementary school site in acreage.  This larger site will provide the ability to have all instructional programs in the same building as well as improved athletic fields and playground facilities for the school.<br></font><li><font face="Arial">We can build a school with greater capacity at Devonshire (500 students versus 350 &#8211; 400 students at Graham Road).  It will be a challenge, however, to find an easy means to take advantage of this greater capacity based upon the demographics of this area, existing boundaries, and the fact that we have both modified and regular calendar elementary schools in the area.<br></font><li><font face="Arial">Renovating/adding to Devonshire will be easier, quicker, and less disruptive than renovating Graham Road as there won&#8217;t be students on that campus during the renovation.<br></font><li><font face="Arial">If the school is relocated to Devonshire, we would have the ability to collaborate with the County to provide both academic and community services in all or part of the vacated Graham Road facility.  However, no funds have been identified by either FCPS or the County to make this happen but there is great interest.</font></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><b><font face="Arial">OPTIONS:</font></b><br><ul><ul><font face="Arial">There are two options.  Renovate the existing school at Graham Road or renovate/add to the former school at the Devonshire site. Staff has no recommendation at this time.  Both options are considered viable.</font></ul></ul><br><b><font face="Arial">RECOMMENDATION:</font></b><br><br><font face="Arial">	That the School Board approve one of the two provided options, as detailed in the agenda item.</font><br><br><font face="Arial">Attachments: 	1.

Final General Assembly actions resulted in a loss of $16.7 million in revenue and an expenditure reduction of $21.8 million, resulting in a net increase of $5.1 million compared to the FY 2009 Advertised Budget.  </font><br><br><font face="Arial">The agenda item includes $0.7 million in ongoing expenditures that were approved in the FY 2008 Third-Quarter Budget Review. Also included are details on the program and summer school redesign, membership adjustments, and budget reductions needed to meet the reduced transfer.  As part of the FY 2009 approved budget process, the School Board approval is required to complete the GASB 45 implementation.</font></ul><br><b><font face="Arial">KEY POINTS:</font></b><br><ul><font face="Arial">The FY 2009 Approved Budget includes a 2.5 percent increase in the county transfer and a net reduction of $39.7 million and 104.1 positions compared to the Advertised Budget.  The market scale adjustment was reduced from 3 percent to 2 percent, expansion of the Foreign Language in Elementary Schools (FLES) to new schools and the full-day kindergarten expansion were eliminated, and savings were realized from program redesign and lower Virginia Retirement System and group life insurance rates.  Expenditure increases are required for the membership increase of 992 additional students for a total of 3,541 students from the FY 2008 approved, bus driver salaries, and for bus/vehicle fuel and labor costs.</font><br><br><font face="Arial">Due to the complexity of the FY 2009 budget, a summary reflecting actions taken from the proposed to the approved is presented first.  </font><br><br><font face="Arial">Implementation of GASB 45 is also addressed in this agenda.  The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement 45 directs how the school system should account for and report costs related to post-employment health care and other non-pension benefits, such as the retiree health benefit subsidy.  This requirement is similar to those for pension benefits.  To prepare for GASB 45, the School Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB) Trust Fund was established to accumulate and invest assets towards reducing the unfunded actuarial accrued liability as part of the FY 2008 Approved Budget.  Beginning in FY 2008, FCPS is required to implement this standard.  </font></ul><br><br><br><b><font face="Arial">RECOMMENDATION:</font></b><br><ul><font face="Arial">1.  That the School Board adopt the FY 2009 Approved Budget, to include revenue and expenditure adjustments, as detailed in the agenda item.</font><br><br><font size="4" face="Arial">2</font><font face="Arial">.  That the School Board approve the attached resolution that establishes a trust for the purpose of accumulating and investing assets to fund other post-employment benefits and pre-fund these benefits by participating in the &#8220;Virginia Pooled Other Post-Employment Benefits Trust Fund&#8221; administered by the Virginia Municipal League and the Virginia Association of Counties, as detailed in the agenda item.</font><br><br><font face="Arial">3.
