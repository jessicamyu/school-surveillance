On July 30, 2008, in accordance with the School Board&#8217;s directive, the Chief Operating Officer executed and delivered the PSA on behalf of the School Board.  </font><br><br><font face="Arial">As reflected in the PSA, the negotiated purchase price of the Facility is $52 million, plus an amount not to exceed $5 million to reimburse the seller for certain documented renovations made by the seller to the Facility. In addition to these acquisition costs, the School Board is expected to finance approximately $56.5 million to renovate and furnish the Facility. In compliance with the terms of the PSA, the School Board posted an initial refundable deposit of $500,000 on July 30, 2008.</font><br><br><font face="Arial">Once finalized, this transaction will (i) complete the consolidation of Fairfax County Public Schools&#8217; administrative offices into a central campus in Falls Church, Virginia, and (ii) combine approximately 1,700 personnel from twelve School Board-owned properties and five leased offices into a single campus.  As outlined during the July 24, 2008 School Board meeting, the final consummation of this transaction is projected to result in significant cost savings to the School Board over time.</font><br><br><font face="Arial">The PSA provides for a 60-day due diligence period that will end on September 29, 2008. This due diligence period has provided school system staff and independent technical advisors the opportunity to inspect and to evaluate the Facility&#8217;s physical features and building systems. This evaluation process is ongoing and school system staff will provide an update to the School Board in closed session. Nevertheless, the School Board retains the right to terminate the PSA, for any reason, including the rejection by the Board of Supervisors of the proposed financing (described below), until September 29, 2008, after which time an additional $500,000 deposit will be due unless the School Board so terminates. After September 29, 2008, the combined $1,000,000 deposit will be non-refundable.  </font><br><div align="center"><i><font face="Arial">Community Engagement</font></i><br></div><br><font face="Arial">A decision to acquire and renovate a second administration building on the Gatehouse campus is an important issue to the school system and the community that we serve.  Because of its importance, efforts have been made to inform the community about this issue and to gain the benefit of their points of view prior to the School Board making a final decision.  To this end, a number of specific communication and feedback initiatives were undertaken over the past two months.  The highlights of these efforts are: </font><br><br><font face="Arial">A website was created with a link to the main FCPS webpage.  This website (</font><a href="http://www.fcps.edu/news/office.htm"><u><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial">http://www.fcps.edu/news/office.htm</font></u></a><font face="Arial">) contains a great deal of information to include a fact sheet, the purchase versus build analysis, an occupancy model assessment, the business model, the background and cost savings of Gatehouse Phase I, and frequently asked questions.  </font><br><br><font face="Arial">The main webpage also has a survey that allows visitors to answer questions and voice their opinions about this issue.  As of September 11, 2008, 489 FCPS employees, Fairfax County residents and community members, and parents of FCPS students responded to the survey.  The majority (76 percent) of respondents were FCPS employees, and a majority of respondents (76 percent) indicated that they were very familiar or familiar with the discussions about the possible purchase.  Respondents cited three top ways they learned about the issue: FCPS web site, media, and word of mouth.  </font><br><br><font face="Arial">At the time of survey collection, approximately 44 percent indicated that they strongly agree or agree (marking a 1,2, or 3 on survey question #4) with the purchase, while 42 percent indicated that they strongly disagree or disagree (marking a 8, 9, or 10) with the purchase. Overall results show that a slight majority of respondents support the acquisition of the 8111 Gatehouse Road property as the second FCPS administration building.</font><br><br><font face="Arial">When asked to cite advantages of the purchase, the three most frequent answers respondents gave were: </font><ul><br><font face="Arial">	This is a great time to purchase real estate with low interest rates and lower property values. </font><br><p><font face="Arial">	Consolidating employees reduces travel time among buildings and increases opportunities for staff to collaborate.</font><br><p><font face="Arial">	Saving money by moving people from older, less energy efficient buildings that are expensive to maintain. </font></ul><br><br><font face="Arial">When asked to cite disadvantages of the purchase, the three most frequent answers respondents gave were: </font><br><ul><br><font face="Arial">	Traffic congestion in and around Gatehouse and employee commutes may be longer. Adding more employees will make traffic worse and make parking and exiting the building even more difficult.</font><br><p><font face="Arial">	The perception that FCPS is spending money on a new building for administrators in a year when we are making drastic budget cuts for school programs and may not give employees raises. </font><br><p><font face="Arial">	If money can be found for an administrative building, then why can&#8217;t it be found for school buildings in need of renovation?</font></ul><br><br><font face="Arial">In addition to sharing information about the proposed building acquisition on the public website, staff met or spoke with elected officials, various school and community groups and leaders, the Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce, representatives of the Fairfax County Federation of Citizens Associations, FCPS principals, and representatives of the Fairfax County Federation of Teachers.  While not all groups provided written statements after these meetings, we did receive supporting letters from the Chamber, the Federation, and the FCFT.  Copies of these documents are attached.</font><br><div align="center"><i><font face="Arial">Financing</font></i></div><br><font face="Arial">If the School Board approves this agenda item, the Board of Supervisors will be asked, at its September 22, 2008 meeting, to take action on the financing arrangements (the Financing) that support the purchase described herein.  In summary, the Financing consists of two phases -- interim and permanent.  The aggregate principal amount of the Financing will not exceed $130M.  The Board of Supervisors will be asked to (i) approve a draw on Fairfax County&#8217;s line of credit with Bank of America, N.A. which will provide interim funding for the initial purchase of the Facility, certain renovation costs and related transaction expenses, and (ii) request that the Fairfax County Economic Development Authority (EDA) provide long-term permanent financing, through the issuance of EDA Bonds, for the Facility and all renovations thereto. </font><br><br><font face="Arial">In order to obtain the Financing, the School Board will assign its rights in the PSA to the EDA with the understanding that the EDA will sell the Facility to the County and the County will lease the Facility to the School Board.  The School Board will make lease payments from its operating budget to the County, which in turn will make installment payments to the EDA to pay the cost of the EDA-issued Bonds.  This is the same transactional structure as was used for the purchase of Gatehouse I Administration Center.</font><br><br><font face="Arial">The Financing is more particularly described in the attached resolution.  </font><br><br><b><font face="Arial">OPTIONS:		         </font></b><font face="Arial">None recommended.</font><br><br><b><font face="Arial">RECOMMENDATION:	</font></b><br><ul><font face="Arial">1.

Also, the basic architecture of SASI does not allow the flexibility to easily interface with other applications and near real-time data reporting is not possible across the district without extensive manual operations. Further, SASI lacks the flexibility to support the student achievement goals.</font><li><font face="Arial">In June 2008 Pearson announced that Version 10 of SASI will be the last version of the product and that support for SASI will cease on August 1, 2010.

The Superintendent has the authority to assign a student to a different school or alternative program. If the Superintendent&#8217;s hearing officer determines that a sanction other than expulsion is appropriate, the case is not forwarded to the School Board for any further action.  However, the current version of P2611 provides the parents with a process to appeal the Superintendent&#8217;s decision to assign a student to another regular or alternative school.  If a parent chooses to appeal that decision, the School Board committee then convenes a hearing to make a decision on whether or not to expel the student. </font><br><br><font face="Arial">Staff is recommending that Policy 2611 be revised to provide parents the opportunity to appeal a hearing officer&#8217;s decision to the School Board, for those cases where the hearing officer has not forwarded the school&#8217;s expulsion recommendation, for review only on the written record.  This written record review will streamline the appeal process by reducing the number of School Board committee hearings, as well as reduce the number of days before a final decision is delivered and thereby hasten students&#8217; receipt of educational services following disciplinary action.  Legal fees for School Board committee hearings also should decrease.</font><br><br><font face="Arial">This revision will make appeals of school assignments consistent with the appeal process currently in place for long term suspensions and for reassignments as a result of criminal charges/convictions based on actions in the community.</font><br><br></ul></ul><b><font face="Arial">RECOMMENDATION:</font></b><br><ul><ul><font face="Arial">That the</font><b><font face="Arial"> </font></b><font face="Arial">School Board adopt Policy 2611.8,  Procedures for Hearings and Appeals to the School Board, as reviewed and discussed at the Policy work session .</font></ul></ul><br><br><font face="Arial">Attachment:  Policy 2611.8, Procedures for Hearings and Appeals to the School Board	</font><a href="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/867BVB242811/$FILE/P2611.8.pdf"><img src="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/867BVB242811/Body/0.120C?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="66" height="47" alt="P2611.8.pdf" border="0"></a><br></div>
