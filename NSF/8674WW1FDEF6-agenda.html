Final State General Assembly actions resulted in an increase of $34.2 million including State Fiscal Stabilization Funding, and revenue from the City of Fairfax decreased $1.2 million as compared to the advertised budget.  All revenue adjustments combined total a reduction of $65.2 million.</font><br><font face="Arial"> </font><br><font face="Arial">Expenditure adjustments for the school operating fund result in a net decrease in expenditures of $113.1 million.  Final State General Assembly actions result in the following reductions: a decrease of $109.1 million for VRS retirement; $5.8 million for the VRS retiree health care credit; $5.7 million for state life insurance; and $0.6 million for the triennial census.  Additional expenditure reductions of $1.3 million result from contract length reductions for career and technical education and academy teachers and school-based technology specialists.  Expenditure increases for County retirement and life insurance require an additional $0.9 million, and funding of $3.0 million is provided for the Priority Schools Initiative which increases the funding available to serve these schools identified based on student need to a total of $4.3 million.  To address changes in student membership and demographics, $5.4 million is required primarily due to an increase in the number of students eligible for free and reduced-price meals.  This increase results in additional teachers provided to elementary and middle schools through FCPS&#8217; needs-based staffing formula.  </font><br><font face="Arial"> </font><br><font face="Arial">The General Assembly adopted a significantly lower rate, deferring contributions to the Virginia Retirement System (VRS) to mitigate the state budget cuts to localities.  In addition to anticipated rate increases, school systems will be required to repay the deferred amounts with interest over a 10 year period.   Therefore, the revenue reduction of $65.2 million combined with the net expenditure reduction of $113.1 million results in an ending balance of $48.0 million which will be placed in a reserve to address future VRS requirements.  </font><br><font face="Arial"> </font><br><font face="Arial">Highlights of the FY 2011 School Operating Fund Approved Budget:</font><ul><ul><font face="Arial"> </font><br><font face="Calibri">&#8226;           </font><font face="Arial">$2.2 billion budget, a decrease of $72.3 million, or 3.2 percent from the estimate; and $34.5 million, or 1.6 percent, from the FY 2010 Approved</font><br><font face="Calibri">&#8226;           </font><font face="Arial">Nearly $200 million in budget reductions and cost avoidances including the elimination of 204.3 positions, nearly half of which are from central offices</font><br><font face="Calibri">&#8226;           </font><font face="Arial">$14.4 million required for membership growth of 1,723 students and demographic shifts resulting in increases in needs-based staffing</font><br><font face="Calibri">&#8226;           </font><font face="Arial">Cost per pupil decreased by approximately $300 from FY 2010; this is the third consecutive year of decreased spending per pupil</font></ul></ul><font face="Arial"> </font></ul></ul><font face="Arial">Changes to other School Board funds are detailed in the attachment.</font><br><b><font face="Arial"> </font></b><br><b><font face="Arial">RECOMMENDATION:</font></b><br><font face="Arial"> </font><br><font face="Arial">That the School Board adopt the FY 2011 Approved Budget, to include the Superintendent&#8217;s proposed revenue and expenditure adjustments, as detailed in the agenda item, and with the following revisions: (1) directing the Superintendent to begin video streaming on the Fairfax County Public Schools website the School Board meetings that are broadcast on FCPS Red Apple Channel 21 at an estimated cost of $8,000 beginning as soon as practicable by reallocating funding within the Cox Communications grant, and (2) restoring funding of $0.2 million for Advanced Academic Center student transportation and reducing the staffing reserve by $0.2 million.</font><br><br><b><u><font face="Arial">MOTION THAT PASSED:</font></u></b><br><br><font face="Arial">The motion to adopt the FY 2011 Approved Budget, to include the Superintendent&#8217;s proposed revenue and expenditure adjustments, as detailed in the agenda item, and with the following revisions: (1) directing the Superintendent to begin video streaming on the Fairfax County Public Schools website the School Board meetings that are broadcast on FCPS Red Apple Channel 21 at an estimated cost of $8,000 beginning as soon as practicable by reallocating funding within the Cox Communications grant; (2) restoring funding of $0.2 million for Advanced Academic Center student transportation and reducing the staffing reserve by $0.2 million; (3) reducing funding for the Priority Schools Initiative (PSI) by $1.3 million, for FY 2011 only, to restore local funding to assist the Title I schools and communities with the transition from the Extended Learning Program and by requesting that the Board of Supervisors provide one time funding in the amount of $1.3 million to replenish the PSI funds to support this transition, the remaining $3 million in PSI funds would be maintained for the PSI initiative, and transition activities funded may include an extended Monday student schedule or other School Improvement Plan activities as developed by the principal and other school staff in conjunction with each school community, provided, however, that if Hollin Meadows Elementary School elects to continue its extended Monday student schedule, then the Hollin Meadows Elementary School counselor who is the spouse of School Board Member Dan Storck shall be ineligible to receive the staff salary supplement associated with such schedule; (4) designating the Priority Schools Initiative as a three-year pilot and by directing the Governance Committee to work with the Superintendent and staff to develop and recommend appropriate monitoring protocols so that the School Board can adequately assess the efficacy of the new Priority Schools Initiative during the pilot period; and (5) reducing the Board&#8217;s VRS Reserve by $3.0 million and by setting aside $3.0 million for employee compensation enhancements for FY 2012</font><font size="4" face="Arial"> </font><b><font face="Arial">passed 10-2.</font></b><font face="Arial">  Ms. Bradsher, Mr. Center, Ms. Evans, Mr. Gibson, Ms. Hone, Mr. Moon, Mrs. Smith, Mr. Storck, Mrs. Strauss, and Mrs. Wilson voted &quot;aye&quot; and Mr. Raney and Mrs. Reed voted &quot;nay.&quot;</font><br><br><br><b><u><font face="Arial">PROPOSED AMENDMENTS</font></u></b><br><ul><font face="Arial">1.
