At present, and without the action recommended above, the annual bond funding available to Fairfax County Public Schools is projected to be $130 million.</font><br><br><font size="4" face="Arial">Discussions between school and County officials resulted in a consensus that recognized the mutual benefits of the County increasing the school system&#8217;s CIP funding over a designated period of time, in return for the school system transferring certain unneeded school properties to the Board of Supervisors.</font><br><br><font size="4" face="Arial">At its regular meeting on February 23, 2006, the School Board agreed to pursue a formal process that would implement transfers of unneeded school properties to the Board of Supervisors, in return for the increased CIP funding for school projects.  In order to ensure that this process is open to the public, the School Board held a public hearing on April 17, 2006, for the purpose of obtaining public comment about the properties being considered for transfer.  The public hearing was advertised in a newspaper of general circulation in the County, and school staff sent notices to adjoining property owners by U.S. Mail.  Approximately ten speakers addressed the School Board on this subject at the April 17th public hearing.</font><br><br><font size="4" face="Arial">At the present time, there are 12 parcels of real property that are not being used for instructional purposes, and for which no future instructional purpose is anticipated.  These properties are being considered for possible transfer.  The list of these properties is attached hereto as Attachment A.  Certain of these parcels are currently used by, and are subject to pre-existing agreements with, the Fairfax County Park Authority.  There are two forms of pre-existing agreements:  (i) an interim use agreement which provides for termination with six months notice; and (ii) a lease agreement pertaining to the Lawyers Road parcel.  The Park Authority has requested that, prior to any transfer of the Lawyers Road parcel to the Board of Supervisors, the School Board first expressly confirm that the transfer of that particular parcel is subject to the terms of the lease agreement by executing an agreed-upon amendment to the existing lease agreement.  County staff has been advised of the Park Authority&#8217;s request and has no objection to the transfer being made subject to the Park Authority rights under the lease agreement.</font><br></ul></ul><font size="4" face="Arial">The terms of the prospective property transfer are outlined in Attachment B, attached hereto.</font><br><font size="4" face="Arial">Attachment A - School Properties Not Presently Used for Instruction</font><a href="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/867LEW28963E/$FILE/Attachment%20A.pdf"><img src="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/867LEW28963E/Body/0.2378?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="90" height="47" alt="Attachment A.pdf" border="0"></a><br><font size="4" face="Arial">Attachment B - Outline of Property Transfer Terms</font><a href="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/867LEW28963E/$FILE/Attachment%20B.pdf"><img src="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/867LEW28963E/Body/0.2FF2?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="90" height="47" alt="Attachment B.pdf" border="0"></a><br></div>
