Final General Assembly actions resulted in a loss of $16.7 million in revenue and an expenditure reduction of $21.8 million, resulting in a net increase of $5.1 million compared to the FY 2009 Advertised Budget.  </font><br><br><font face="Arial">The agenda item includes $0.7 million in ongoing expenditures that were approved in the FY 2008 Third-Quarter Budget Review. Also included are details on the program and summer school redesign, membership adjustments, and budget reductions needed to meet the reduced transfer.  As part of the FY 2009 approved budget process, the School Board approval is required to complete the GASB 45 implementation.</font></ul><br><b><font face="Arial">KEY POINTS:</font></b><br><ul><font face="Arial">The FY 2009 Approved Budget includes a 2.5 percent increase in the county transfer and a net reduction of $39.7 million and 104.1 positions compared to the Advertised Budget.  The market scale adjustment was reduced from 3 percent to 2 percent, and savings were realized from program redesign and lower Virginia Retirement System and group life insurance rates.  Expenditure increases are required for the membership increase of 992 additional students for a total of 3,541 students from the FY 2008 approved, bus driver salaries, and for bus/vehicle fuel and labor costs.</font><br><br><font face="Arial">Due to the complexity of the FY 2009 budget, a summary reflecting actions taken from the proposed to the approved is presented first.  </font><br><br><font face="Arial">Implementation of GASB 45 is also addressed in this agenda.  The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement 45 directs how the school system should account for and report costs related to post-employment health care and other non-pension benefits, such as the retiree health benefit subsidy.  This requirement is similar to those for pension benefits.  To prepare for GASB 45, the School Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB) Trust Fund was established to accumulate and invest assets towards reducing the unfunded actuarial accrued liability as part of the FY 2008 Approved Budget.  Beginning in FY 2008, FCPS is required to implement this standard.  </font></ul><br><b><font face="Arial">RECOMMENDATION:</font></b><br><ul><font face="Arial">1.  That the School Board adopt the FY 2009 Approved Budget, to include revenue and expenditure adjustments, as detailed in the agenda item, and with the following revisions: (a) re-allocating $1 million from the instructional supply set-aside to the staffing reserve to be used to mitigate staffing issues which may arise from the increase of .5 students in small schools, the loss of Title I funding, or other situations which cause schools to lose a disproportionate amount of staffing, or where class size exceeds 30 students in elementary schools; (b) restoring funding of $1.2 million to expand full-day kindergarten to four schools; funding of $1.2 million will result from reducing replacement equipment by $0.2 million and reducing funding for the replacement of the student information system (SASI) by $1.0 million; and (c) restoring funding of $0.2 million to expand Foreign Language in the Elementary Schools (FLES) to four schools; funding of $0.2 million will result from reducing replacement equipment by $0.2 million.</font><br><br><font size="4" face="Arial">2</font><font face="Arial">.  That the School Board approve the attached resolution that establishes a trust for the purpose of accumulating and investing assets to fund other post-employment benefits and pre-fund these benefits by participating in the &#8220;Virginia Pooled Other Post-Employment Benefits Trust Fund&#8221; administered by the Virginia Municipal League and the Virginia Association of Counties, as detailed in the agenda item.</font><br><br><font face="Arial">3.  That the School Board appoint the Deferred Compensation Board of Fairfax County Public Schools to serve the OPEB Trust Board of Fairfax County Public Schools as the trustee and direct the OPEB Trust Board of Fairfax County Public Schools to execute and deliver the Trust Joinder Agreement for Participating Employers under Virginia Pooled OPEB Trust Fund, as detailed in the agenda item.</font><br><ul></div>

A Capstone Program called Finance Park which is targeted for a middle school audience consists of 26 forty-five minute lessons on personal financial literacy, supported by teacher instruction and student workbooks.  This program culminates in a field trip to an interactive site where students apply the knowledge and skills they have learned in the classroom.  When students arrive at the Finance Park site, they become &#8220;an adult for the day&#8221;.  The students are given an identity card with a description of a person's personal life: their marital status, children, income and occupation.  Students are then faced with making decisions regarding household expenses.  The goal is for them to develop a balanced budget.  </font><br><font face="Times New Roman"> </font><br><font face="Arial">The Finance Park site is divided into stations which represent the various components of a household budget such as utilities, savings, entertainment, housing, automobiles, etc.  At each station, there is a computer in which students will gather information about the related expenses and later enter their own information based upon the decisions they have made.  At the end of the experience, students receive a printout with their budget.  </font><br><font face="Times New Roman"> </font><br><font face="Arial">FCPS has had access to this interactive site which is presently a mobile unit located on the grounds of Capital One headquarters in McLean.  In fall 2006, eighth grade students from Rocky Run MS participated in a pilot of this program.  Since then the mobile unit has been brought back to the area and students from the summer school program for civics (summer 2007), and six additional middle schools have participated in the program and visited the Finance Park mobile unit.  The overall response from participation in this interactive program has been positive by all involved: students, parents, and teachers.  </font><br><br><font face="Arial">The Washington Capital Region of Junior Achievement is now proposing a long term partnership with FCPS to build a permanent structure that would house this program and allow all eighth grade students in FCPS to take part in this personal financial literacy curriculum.  Forming this partnership would facilitate all of our middle school students meeting many of the Economics Education and Financial Literacy Objectives required by Virginia Department of Education in April 2006. </font><br><br><font face="Arial">Estimated annual expenses for implementation of JA Finance Park include the following:</font><br><br><table width="100%" border="1"><tr valign="top"><td width="61%"><font face="Arial">Student fee ($20 per student X 11,500 students)</font></td><td width="39%"><font face="Arial">$ 230,000</font></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="61%"><font face="Arial">One Resource teacher (218 contract to facilitate training, scheduling, Curriculum implementation)	</font></td><td width="39%"><font face="Arial">$   80,055</font></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="61%"><font face="Arial">Substitutes (4 per school x $125; will vary according to the needs</font><br><font face="Arial">of the school)	</font></td><td width="39%"><font face="Arial">$  13,500</font></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="61%"><font face="Arial">Teacher training stipend (approx 250 teachers -- grade 8 civics &amp;</font><br><font face="Arial">250 grade 8 mathematics &amp; Algebra teachers X $100)</font></td><td width="39%"><font face="Arial">$  50,000</font></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="61%"><font face="Arial">Student transportation	</font></td><td width="39%"><font face="Arial">$  88,220</font></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="61%"><font face="Arial">Facility maintenance and operations (includes utilities, grounds,</font><br><font face="Arial">major maintenance/infrastructure replacement, custodial, insurance)</font></td><td width="39%"><font face="Arial">$  84,900</font></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="61%"><img width="1" height="1" src="/icons/ecblank.gif" border="0" alt=""></td><td width="39%"><img width="1" height="1" src="/icons/ecblank.gif" border="0" alt=""></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="61%"><font face="Arial">Total</font></td><td width="39%"><font face="Arial">$ 546,775</font></td></tr></table><font face="Arial">			</font><br><font face="Arial">       </font><br><font face="Arial">In addition to the costs outlined above, FCPS will lease to JA, for one dollar ($1) per year, a parcel of property on the grounds of the Woodson/Frost campus upon which JA will construct a facility to house the Finance Park program operations.
