<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="line-height:107%">The School Board Character Award was initiated by former Student Representative to the School Board Chris Giovarelli and established by the Student Advisory Council in 2001. The Apple Federal Credit Union Education Foundation has generously funded the $500 award since 2007. The award is given to a junior or senior who demonstrates a continuous record of high morals, strong integrity, and good character, and who is recognized as a role model for students in Fairfax County Public Schools in day-to-day behavior.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="line-height:107%">The recipient of the 2019 School Board Character award is <b>Camden Wiseman</b>, a senior at TJHSST.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="line-height:107%">Camden is a powerful source of inspiration for the TJHSST community. As a survivor of childhood cancer and volunteer ambassador for the Childhood Brain Tumor Foundation, Camden has shared his story in hopes it will inspire others to find strength and power in their own lives. His positive words and actions encourage his peers to pursue their own unique passions in making the world a better place. According to one counselor, &ldquo;Camden has grown into an amazing advocate for himself as well as others and enriches the lives of everyone around him. Simply put, I&rsquo;m better for knowing him.&rdquo; </span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="line-height:107%">Camden is an intrepid, buoyant thinker whose residual vision impairment has not deterred him from serving his community. Camden is the captain of his chess team, and in this leadership role, founded a chess outreach program at an FCPS Title I elementary school where he and his teammates provide free chess instruction to students on a weekly basis. He has also served on his school&rsquo;s honor council for the past two years, been a certified soccer referee since 2013, and was selected to serve as his National Honor Society chapter&rsquo;s Service Chair where he has helped coordinate events for causes such as safe teen driving, food for homeless shelters, bookmarks for kids at low-income elementary schools, a book drive at a nearby synagogue, and a pet toy drive for an animal shelter.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="line-height:107%">With great dedication and a courageous spirit, Camden eagerly anticipates broadening his exposure to economics, finance, and frontier oncology breakthroughs and aspires to a business career that encompasses cancer research advocacy. Camden&rsquo;s high morals, strong integrity, and resilience epitomize the character traits we want to see in all of our students. Through his exceptional work ethic, he has developed an admirable profile in academics, athletics, and community service. Camden has earned and truly deserves the School Board Character Award. </span></span></span></p>

<div class="itembody"><p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;">Laura Ashley Piper served as student representative to the Fairfax County School Board from 1986 to 1987. This outstanding student, talented athlete, and exceptional leader graduated from Robinson Secondary School and the Air Force Academy and was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the Air Force. She was killed in action over northern Iraq in April 1994. To honor Laura Ashley Piper&rsquo;s strong commitment to student participation and to recognize her high standards of achievement and involvement and her willingness to continually accept responsibility throughout her lifetime, the School Board of Fairfax County has established the annual $1,000 Laura Ashley Piper Scholarship.&nbsp; In 2007, Apple Federal Credit Union Education Foundation began its endowment of the Laura Ashley Piper Scholarship, providing $1,000 annually.&nbsp; We appreciate their continued generosity. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;">Each year, every high school may nominate one senior student who exemplifies the &ldquo;attributes of personal excellence and commitment to student government&rdquo; of Lt. Piper. A committee from the Office of School Counseling Services, Department of Instructional Services, considers the nominees. There is an engraved plaque in the School Board Office with each winner&rsquo;s name.</span></span></p>

<div class="itembody"><p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Fairfax County Public Schools and the police departments of Fairfax County, Fairfax City and the Town of Herndon have enjoyed a mutually beneficial relationship for more than two decades. One of the hallmarks of this relationship is the School Resource Officer (SRO) program. SROs partner with school administrators to ensure safe, productive, and inviting school environments for students and staff by deterring crime, maintaining orderly schools, and preventing truancy.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">In addition, SROs provide relevant safety education programs to FCPS students. Many SROs also volunteer as student mentors through the Mentorworks Program, serving as trusted adults that students can depend on to assist them in making healthy and safe choices. Furthermore, SROs play a critical role in ensuring the success of the Alternative Accountability Program, a collaborative and community-oriented response to juvenile offenses that utilizes the principles of restorative justice to hold students accountable for their actions, while at the same time preventing formal Court involvement and satisfying the needs of victims.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Simply put, in order for students to be successful, they require safe and productive learning environments. Our SROs help provide these positive environments and also establish valued and trusted relationships with students and staff. </span></span></p>

Prevention, identification, and abatement of hazards are integral parts of every employee&rsquo;s job. </span></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span lang="EN" style="background:white">During National Safety Month, we also honor Law Enforcement Officers of every rank and file who have chosen a profession that puts their lives on the line every day for the safety of their communities. They&rsquo;ve answered a call to public service that is demanding and often unappreciated. On this day we have an opportunity to thank these dedicated men and women for the service and sacrifices they make for our communities. </span><span lang="EN">They </span>selflessly confront danger to protect our families and defend our communities. These officers serve with courage, dedication, and strength, fearlessly enforcing our laws, even at the risk of personal peril, safeguarding our property, our liberty, and our lives.

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">The FY 2020 employee calendar currently includes 12 holidays for twelve-month employees which was aligned with 11.5 holidays designated for Fairfax County Government employees. </span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">For the 2019-2020 school year, the July 4<sup>th</sup> holiday falls on a Thursday and Friday, July 5<sup>th</sup> is currently scheduled as a work day. </span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">The Fairfax County Board of Supervisors recently authorized July 5<sup>th</sup> as an additional holiday for county employees. Additionally, the Virginia Governor authorized July 5<sup>th</sup> as an additional holiday for state employees earlier in May. </span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">It <span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">is recommended that July 5, 2019, also be authorized as an additional holiday for all twelve-month Fairfax County Public Schools employees to remain in alignment with the county. This also provides the School Board with an opportunity to recognize the work of twelve-month employees and thank them for dedication with a much deserved four-day weekend. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12px;">Summary/Background {Key Points):</span></span></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12px;">A committee was assembled for a second consecutive year to assist in the development of the calendar. The committee was composed of representatives from a variety of internal and external constituent groups which included community religious organization representatives, teachers, employees and principal association representatives, along with central office staff. The 2020 - 2021 Standard School Year Calendar was developed with a focus on instruction and learning time for students. While teaching and learning was the priority, a multitude of factors were considered and balanced during the development of the calendar.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12px;">A calendar survey was administered to families and employees from May 13 &ndash; 23, 2019. The survey collected feedback from participants on their overall preferences related to the student calendar and preference between Version 1 or Version 2 for the 2020-2021 calendar.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12px;">Recommendation: That the School Board adopt the 2020-2021 standard school year calendar.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Subject:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Appointments to School Board Citizen Advisory Committees</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Key Points:</strong></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The current version of Policy 1710 establishes nine standing citizen advisory committees to the School Board, setting forth their authority, responsibility, and representation. By policy, committee members &ldquo;shall be residents of Fairfax County or employees of Fairfax County Public Schools,&rdquo; and &ldquo;to the maximum extent possible, appointments made by School Board members should reflect the religious, cultural, and ethnic diversity of the areas they represent.&rdquo; Additional committee members are selected as provided for in the current version of Regulation 1710. All appointments shall be approved by the School Board.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Members of the citizen advisory committees serve one-year terms, as do the student representative&rsquo;s appointees. All terms begin in July and end in June.&nbsp; </span></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Members of the FECEP-Head Start Parent Policy committee and Title I District Advisory are selected according to federal mandates and are confirmed by the School Board each year in November.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Membership in the Facilities Planning Advisory Council (FPAC) is handled differently, as the terms vary.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Nominees to be appointed or reappointed by this action will be listed by committee in the attachment. </span></span></li>
