	<strong>Meeting Category: &nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>June 29</span>, 2010 - Work Session No.137<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Subject: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Clifton Elementary School Facilities Issues<br />
	<br />
	<strong>School Board Action Required:&nbsp; </strong>Information<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Key Points: </strong><br />
	<br />
	Based upon the independent and objective evaluation of building conditions conducted in 1999, Clifton Elementary School was placed in the renovation queue that was approved by the School Board.&nbsp; The board has used this queue to determine the sequence of renovations to be included in the Board&rsquo;s adopted Capital Improvement Program.&nbsp; Funding for planning this renovation was included in the 2005 and 2007 referenda.&nbsp; Planning has not begun, however, because of the unique and challenging aspects of the Clifton site. </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The decision to close or renovate Clifton ES School should be based on the issues of the reliability of the water supply, declining enrollment and renovation costs and not by the potential impact on future boundary studies.</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><br />
	</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The School Board has two clear options available:</span></span></p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Close Clifton ES</span></span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Renovate Clifton ES</span></span></li>
</ol>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">After updating its own feasibility study and after considering the work of the Southwestern region ad hoc study committee, staff is recommending that Clifton Elementary School be closed. </span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><br />
	</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The specific reasons for staff&rsquo;s recommendation are as follows:</span></span></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The unique topographical and well water challenges of the Clifton Elementary School site will result in higher than normal renovation costs.&nbsp; </span></span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Because the school will continue to rely upon well water, there is some level of risk that, even after a renovation, there could continue to be problems with water quantity and quality.</span></span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Enrollment is declining at Clifton Elementary School with the 2015 projection being 298 students.</span></span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Due to the higher than normal construction costs, and the low student enrollment, the cost per student to renovate Clifton will be much greater than other recent renovations.&nbsp; We estimate the Clifton cost per student to be $35,287 (renovated for a capacity of 312 students).&nbsp; The currently underway renovation of Mount Eagle, a similar sized school, has a renovation cost per student of only $24,740.</span></span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">FCPS has a history of closing schools when enrollments become too low or when site and building challenges do not allow renovations to bring a building up to current educational specifications or the costs to so become prohibitive.&nbsp; More recently, the School Board decided to move Graham Road ES from its current location to the Devonshire site for reasons similar to Clifton - site constraints and higher costs associated with renovation of the existing school.&nbsp; In prior years, Chapel Square, Wilton Woods, Pine Ridge, Masonville, Walnut Hill and Virginia Hills were all schools that were closed by action of the School Board.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The capital program annual spending limit of $155 million, established by the Board of Supervisors, is inadequate to meet the capital needs of the school system as shown in the School Board&rsquo;s annual capital improvement program.&nbsp; The lack of adequate funding means that many schools are not being renovated in a timely manner and too many schools have trailers to address overcrowding.&nbsp; In order to address needed renovations and overcrowding, the School Board must use the monies that are available in the most effective manner possible.&nbsp; </span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">There are consequences for each of the two options available to the School Board, including the following more substantive concerns.</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><br />
	</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><u>Close Clifton Elementary School</u></span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Closing this school will mean that funds identified in the Capital Improvement Program for its renovation can be reassigned by the School Board to other capital projects such as renovations, capacity enhancements (new schools, building additions, modulars), or special programs such as all day kindergarten.</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Closing the school will add to the elementary school capacity deficit in that region.&nbsp; Some of this deficit can be solved by moving programs and/or changing existing boundaries but solving the deficit will require capacity enhancement projects.&nbsp; Staff estimates that these capital projects would have to add about <u>43 classrooms</u> depending upon the results of the boundary process. </span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Options for the use of the site will be pursued.</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><u>Renovate Clifton Elementary School</u></span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">If the School Board decides to renovate Clifton Elementary School, staff continues to recommend that a complete renovation be conducted.&nbsp; The estimated cost per student referenced in this agenda item is based upon a full renovation.&nbsp; Staff notes that the School Board has never reduced the scope of prior renovations as a means to reduce costs. Depending on the boundary study, staff estimates that about <u>30 classrooms</u> would have to be constructed to help address overcrowding in this region of the county.&nbsp; Clifton would be part of the boundary study.</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong>Recommendation:</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">That the School Board approve closing Clifton Elementary School, with the specific closure date to be determined by the Board after the conclusion of the Southwestern Boundary study.<br />
