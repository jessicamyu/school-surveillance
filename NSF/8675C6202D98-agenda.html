Thus far, uses have primarily been at high schools, with a few non-high school exceptions where light poles existed previously. On January 21, 2010, FCPS staff met with the Fairfax County Planning Commission&#8217;s Policy and Procedures Committee to review a potential change in School Board policy that would allow </font><b><font face="Arial">inconspicuous</font></b><font face="Arial"> poles, such as tree poles, at FCPS locations to include elementary and middle school sites. In addition, staff met with the School Board at the April 5, 2010, work session to advise the School Board of the potential benefits that could result from expansion of the FCPS monopole program. At that time the School Board directed staff to forward its recommendations for information, discussion, and action by the School Board.</font><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><b><font face="Arial"> </font></b></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><b><font face="Arial">Key Points:</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial"> </font></b><br><font face="Arial">1.  Public sites, such as School Board-owned property, remain the preferred locations for new telecommunication facilities.</font><br><br><font face="Arial">2.  Ideally, telecommunication facilities should be constructed in areas to blend with an existing pattern of tall structures, and should be </font><b><font face="Arial">inconspicuous</font></b><font face="Arial"> so as to resemble other man-made structures, such as light poles, and natural features, such as trees.</font><br><font face="Arial"> </font><br><font face="Arial">3.  The FCPS monopole program generates revenues that support the instructional program, communications safety initiatives, as well as local school programs/activities.</font><br><br><b><font face="Arial">4.  FCPS staff will continue to coordinate with Fairfax County&#8217;s Department of Planning and Zoning and the County&#8217;s Planning Commission to expand the FCPS monopole program, including the introduction and implementation of  telecommunication facilities at elementary and middle school sites, in order to:</font></b><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><b><font face="Arial">a.

The permanent drainage easement burdens 4,811 s.f. of property and will overlap an existing sanitary sewer easement.  The School Board&#8217;s Office of Design and Construction Services (&quot;Staff&quot;), in consultation with School Board counsel, reviewed VDOT's design plans and its initial offer of compensation and conferred with real estate appraiser Tom Reed, Jr.  Staff determined that VDOT's initial offer was not consistent with the fair market value of the affected property.  Following a period of negotiation, VDOT sent a revised offer on February 3, 2010.  Staff determined that VDOT's revised offer of compensation does represent fair market value for the affected property.
