<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Veterans&#39; Day (formerly Armistice Day), is the anniversary of the Armistice which was signed in the Forest of Compiegne by the Allies and the Germans in 1918, ending World War I, after four years of conflict.<br />
	<br />
	At 5 a.m., on Monday, November 11, 1918, the Germans signed the Armistice, an order was issued for all firing to cease; so the hostilities of the First World War ended. This day began with the laying down of arms, blowing of whistles, impromptu parades, and closing of places of business. All over the globe there were many demonstrations; no doubt the world had never before witnessed such rejoicing.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Veterans&#39; Day is observed annually in the United States in honor of all those, living and dead, who served with the U. S. armed forces.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The School Board directs school personnel to provide students with instructional activities that honor veterans and recognize the role of the military in American democracy.</span></span></p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Geography Awareness Week was established by presidential proclamation in 1987 to underscore the importance of geographic understanding to ensure our nation&rsquo;s economic competitiveness, national security, environmental sustainability, and livability of our communities in the 21st century.</span></span></p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The theme of this year&rsquo;s School Psychology Awareness Week, &quot;Every link matters.&nbsp; Make a connection.&rdquo; focuses on the work school psychologists do to help students strengthen positive relationships and increase positive connections within the school community, their academics and their lives.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">School psychologists work with students in early childhood settings and elementary and secondary schools. &nbsp;They collaborate with teachers, parents, and school personnel to create safe, healthy, and supportive learning environments for all students. &nbsp;School psychologists address students&#39; learning and behavioral problems, suggest improvements to classroom management strategies or parenting techniques, and evaluate students with disabilities and advanced academic students to help determine the best way to educate them.<br />
	<br />
	They improve teaching, learning, and socialization strategies based on their understanding of the psychology of learning environments. &nbsp;They also may evaluate the effectiveness of academic programs, prevention programs, behavior management procedures, and other services provided in the school setting.</span></span></p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">The School Board annually adopts a legislative program to inform public officials and others of its positions on legislative policy issues of importance to the Fairfax County Public Schools.&nbsp; The program contains the School Board&rsquo;s positions on state and federal issues of major and current significance.</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">The attached 2012 FCSB Legislative Program includes additions, subtractions and formatting changes. These changes are intended to reflect actions taken over the past year by state and federal government, to reflect the current policy climate, to incorporate staff recommendations, and to update, simplify and streamline existing position language.&nbsp; The proposed 2012 Legislative Program reflects changes discussed by the School Board at work sessions held on September 12 and October 17, 2011.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The 2012-2014 Local Composite Index data will not be available from the state until mid to late November. &nbsp;&nbsp;The table &ldquo;About the Local Composite Index&rdquo; in the Education Funding &ndash; State position will be updated as soon as that data is released.</span></span></p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong><u>Motion that Passed:</u></strong></span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The motion to adopt the 2012 Fairfax County School Board Legislative Program, as detailed in the agenda item, and as amended to: (1) add the following position to the 2012 Legislative Program: School Board Elections&mdash;The Fairfax County School Board supports granting authority to the Fairfax County School Board to allow its members to be elected for staggered terms; (2) add the following language to the Standards of Accreditation and Standards of Learning position: The Fairfax County School Board supports Standards of Learning (SOL) and SOL curriculum guidelines that strike an appropriate balance between a broad overview of a subject area and in-depth exploration of components within, and interrelationships between, subject areas; (3) add the following sentence to the end of the first bullet of the Freedom of Information Act position:&nbsp; Revision and amendment are particularly important in light of the growth of the use of electronic communications to communicate more quickly and efficiently with the public, including but not limited to web pages and &ldquo;social media&rdquo;; (4) add the following clarifying language to the fourth bullet of the Freedom of Information Act position:&nbsp; &ldquo;&hellip;and to the provisions of the Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act&rdquo;; so that the fourth bullet reads as follows:&nbsp; The FCSB supports changes to the current FOIA exemptions for human resources investigations and to the provisions of the Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act to clarify that the subject of an investigation may only access investigative report materials once the investigation is complete, and that witness names may be redacted from the final report; (5) add the following new bullet to the Freedom of Information Act position:&nbsp; The FCSB supports the creation of a &ldquo;third party disclosure&rdquo; FOIA exemption.&nbsp; For example, when one citizen emails another without writing or copying a public body, and that private email is subsequently forwarded to a public body with a message, a third party disclosure exemption would exempt the original private email from disclosure in response to a FOIA request; (6) add the following new bullet to the Freedom of Information Act position:&nbsp; The FCSB supports specifically allowing for reimbursement for the costs of redaction that are mandated or allowed by other federal and state statutes (e.g. redactions required under FERPA, etc.), <strong>passed 11-1.</strong></span></span></p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Related to:</strong>&nbsp; Legal Requirement</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Key Points:</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The ERFC Board of Trustees is recommending an amendment to the ERFC Defined Benefit Plan (<em>ERFC) </em>as the result of a VRS amendment that the Virginia Legislature adopted in the 2011 Session.&nbsp; The proposed <em>ERFC </em>amendment would maintain <em>ERFC</em>&rsquo;s status as a source only of supplemental benefits.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><em>ERFC</em>, the Legacy Plan, was designed to supplement benefits that members receive from VRS. The benefit formulas achieve this purpose by specifying a percentage of the member&rsquo;s final average salary (the &ldquo;total promised benefit&rdquo;) and calculating the <em>ERFC</em> benefit as that total amount minus the amount that VRS is expected to pay based on the member&rsquo;s creditable service under VRS (&ldquo;the VRS benefit reduction&rdquo;).&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">When the benefit formulas were drafted, there was only one circumstance in which a member might forfeit his or her VRS service credit, with the result that the VRS benefit reduction would be zero.&nbsp; That circumstance was the member&rsquo;s voluntary withdrawal of accumulated VRS member contributions. In order to protect <em>ERFC </em>from paying the total promised benefit in such a situation, the <em>ERFC</em> Plan document provides that such forfeited VRS service credit continues to be counted in calculating the VRS benefit reduction.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">In the 2011 Legislative Session, the Virginia Legislature amended the VRS statute to add another way that a member&rsquo;s VRS service credits can be forfeited.&nbsp; An amendment to Virginia Code &sect; 51.1-124.13 provides that a VRS member who commits a felony in connection with his or her VRS-covered employment after July 1, 2011, will lose the right to VRS benefits based on service previously accumulated.&nbsp; All VRS service credit up to that date is considered to have been &ldquo;relinquished.&rdquo;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">In order to make certain that any such relinquishment of VRS service credit will not result in a VRS benefit reduction equal to zero, the Trustees recommend a clarifying amendment to the <em>ERFC</em> Plan document.&nbsp; The recommended amendment would provide that any service credit relinquished pursuant to Virginia Code &sect; 51.1-124.13 will be counted in calculating the VRS benefit reduction, in the same manner that service forfeited by withdrawal of VRS contributions is counted.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">No similar amendment is needed for <em>ERFC 2001 </em>Plan document because&nbsp; <em>ERFC 2001</em> benefits are based on a different formula that does not include a VRS benefit reduction.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">A proposed Amendment Number 2 is attached for review and approval. </span></span></p>
