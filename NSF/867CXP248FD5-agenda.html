As a result of these meetings the Committee has prepared a series of tip sheets or suggestions for parents on how they can be more effective advocates for their children and partner with the schools.</font></ul></ul><br><b><font face="Arial">RECOMMENDATION:</font></b><ul><font face="Arial">1.	To increase the effectiveness of efforts already underway&#8212;such as promoting the </font><i><font face="Arial">Advocacy Handbook for Parents</font></i><font face="Arial"> or maximizing the impact of the new &#8220;Building the Future&#8221; initiative&#8212;MSAOC has identified a number of specific actions that the School Board can take to advance our goals:</font></ul><ul><font face="Arial">2.	Ensure that FCPS student goals are widely discussed and disseminated in the community in clear and easy format and can be accessed from the FCPS website in multiple languages. </font><br><br><font face="Arial">3.	Support the recruitment and training of Parent Liaisons who can communicate with the minority parent community and make the position full-time.</font></ul><ul><font face="Arial">4.	Promote the </font><i><font face="Arial">Advocacy Handbook for Parents</font></i><font face="Arial"> (and translate the Handbook into additional languages, including Chinese and Arabic).</font></ul><ul><font face="Arial">5.	Encourage schools to offer meetings at a variety of times for parents (including weekends), and use as many communications means as possible to reach parents (e.g., &#8220;Keep in Touch,&#8221; e-mail, FCPS 24/7, biweekly e-mail reports, automated phone calls, phone trees, Parent Liaison networks).</font></ul><ul><font face="Arial">6.	Support the development of free educational seminars and workshops for parents in multiple languages to help them become advocates for their children.</font></ul><ul><font face="Arial">7.	Support the expansion of diversity training for school counselors, teachers, administrators, and others in the school system.</font></ul><ul><font face="Arial">8.	Continue to form partnerships with community centers, faith-based organizations, language-specific groups, and others that already interact with hard-to-reach families. Participate in parent meetings or events such as those sponsored by MSAOC, CPMSAC and Nadir Por Vida.</font><br><br><font face="Arial">9.	Use visual, easy-to-understand formats for printed communication with parents in multiple languages.</font></ul><ul><font face="Arial">10.	Support an open climate at schools so that parents feel more welcome and empowered to take ownership of their children&#8217;s education. Help school administrators and teachers explain to parents why the School Board is important to their children.</font></ul><br><font face="Arial">Attachment: MSAOC Annual Report</font><a href="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/867CY5249025/$FILE/MSAOCReport.pdf"><img src="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/867CY5249025/Body/0.1458?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="97" height="48" alt="MSAOCReport.pdf" border="0"></a></div>

The regulations state that the composition of the committee shall include parents of children 	with disabilities and persons with disabilities.</font><br><font face="Arial">			</font><br><b><font face="Arial">KEY POINTS:</font></b><font face="Arial">  </font><br><br><font face="Arial">	The ACSD made the following recommendations:</font><ul><ul><ul type="disc"><li><font face="Arial">Establish a permanent FCPS Reading Committee charged to meet every three years to review the efficacy of reading programs in use and examine any new trends in current reading research in order to make recommendations and revisions to FCPS reading programming. This committee would be comprised of FCPS reading specialists, special and general education teachers, private sector reading experts, parents and a representative from the School Board. A report of the committee findings should be made available to the School Board.</font><li><font face="Arial">Assess and choose reading programs based on their usability across the diverse student populations in FCPS and on standard criteria approved by the Superintendent and the School Board.</font><li><font face="Arial">Evaluate all children in special education for an accurate yearly reading level with a standardized norm-referenced measure, as opposed to the widely used DRA2 which is an informal measure, (that is standardized to give grade level equivalents). The results should be collected county wide and reported to the school board annually.</font><li><font face="Arial">Allocate more uninterrupted time on basic reading instruction at the elementary level.  If a student at the secondary level is in need of explicit, targeted, and intensive reading instruction, the corresponding courses should be mandatory and count toward graduation.</font><li><font face="Arial">Allocate the majority of the FCPS reading training budget to programs that can be implemented at both the elementary and secondary levels rather than on programs that end at the elementary level.</font><li><font face="Arial">Create a formalized process that requires intervention with a standardized reading program when a student is more than a year and a half behind in grade level.</font><li><font face="Arial">Add &#8220;IEP team review of the Record of Reading Process&#8221; to the IEP Meeting Agenda to ensure the system-wide implementation of the form.</font><li><font face="Arial">FCPS implement a formal accountability mechanism to ensure that the following administrative groups are effectively using their training with regards to IDEA, NCLB and other State and Federal Regulations:</font><p><font face="Arial">Principals and their designees;</font><br><font face="Arial">PRSs and ISRTs;</font><br><font face="Arial">The Office of Monitoring and Compliance </font><br><li><font face="Arial">FCPS increase the availability of the following:</font><p><font face="Arial">1.	Smaller school, pyramid and cluster-based training so to better fulfill the specific training needs of these groups;</font><br><font face="Arial">2.	IEP training focused on improving the effectiveness of IEPs, to include meaningful goal writing, data collection, and baseline data 	collection for both new and veteran teachers;</font><br><font face="Arial">3.	Low-incidence disability training for both new and veteran teachers.</font><li><font face="Arial">To support the increasing need for well trained substitute paraprofessionals throughout the school year, FCPS increase the paraprofessional substitute salary to be commensurate with the substitute teacher salary.</font><li><font face="Arial">FCPS mandate that My PLT be a part of each school&#8217;s School Improvement Plan to further ensure accountability across the board with easy tracking and data collection regarding how much and what types of training each FCPS employee receives. </font><li><font face="Arial">After the initial pilot, FCPS develop a set of guidelines to ensure that schools go through the self-assessment process consistently throughout the district.  The guidelines should specify the following:  </font><p><font face="Arial">1.	Need for broad parent involvement in the process, including as many parents of children with disabilities as practicable; </font><br><font face="Arial">2.	Inclusion of students with disabilities in the process as appropriate, and fully at the high school level; </font><br><font face="Arial">3.	Review of individual responses to the Self-Assessment so that group analysis of the responses can determine where 			perspectives may be radically different or further information about school programs is needed; </font><br><font face="Arial">4.	Development of a team process for analyzing the survey findings, resulting in an &quot;as is&quot; written synopsis of the school's current 	inclusion practices; </font><br><font face="Arial">5.	Process for holding discussions that respect the viewpoints and priorities of all involved,  in order to create an action plan to 		move the school from its current &quot;as is&quot; state to a more inclusive community.

Requirement that an action plan be incorporated into the school plan; and</font><br><font face="Arial">7.	Need for wide dissemination of the school plan and opportunities for public discussion.  </font><br><font face="Arial">8.	Review of each principal&#8217;s plan for disseminating the survey, including who receives the assessment, what the expected 		response rates are, and how the principal intends to use the plan to improve the school.</font><br><li><font face="Arial">After the initial pilot, FCPS develop a set of guidelines to ensure that schools go through the self-assessment process consistently throughout the district.
