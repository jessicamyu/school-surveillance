Offering beneficiaries other than spouses an opportunity to roll over distributions received due to the death of a member.</font></b><ul><br><font face="Arial">Until the Pension Protection Act (PPA) was signed into law in August 2006 federal law permitted only members and spouses to roll over distributions they receive from a qualified retirement plan into an IRA in order to continue deferring federal taxes on the distribution.  Effective January 1, 2007, the PPA permits retirement plans to offer a roll-over opportunity to other beneficiaries who receive distributions due to the death of a member.  The proposed amendment would allow ERFC beneficiaries to take advantage of this opportunity for tax deferral to the full extent of federal law. </font><br></ul><b><font face="Arial">B.	Clarifying the age at which standard benefit payments from </font></b><b><i><font face="Arial">ERFC</font></i></b><b><font face="Arial"> are reduced after retirement. </font></b><ul><br><font face="Arial">The </font><i><font face="Arial">ERFC </font></i><font face="Arial">plan was designed to supplement benefits that members receive from both VRS and Social Security.  If a member retires before the age at which full Social Security benefits can begin, the standard benefit formula under </font><i><font face="Arial">ERFC</font></i><font face="Arial"> pays a larger amount at retirement and a reduced amount after the member becomes eligible for full Social Security benefits.  (The plan offers optional forms of benefit, with equivalent actuarial value, for those members who prefer to receive level lifetime benefits.) Under federal law, full Social Security benefits used to begin at age 65; that age now scales up to 67 based upon the individual&#8217;s birth date.  The </font><i><font face="Arial">ERFC </font></i><font face="Arial">plan document currently refers to the age at which benefits change as &#8220;the member&#8217;s 65</font><sup><font face="Arial">th</font></sup><font face="Arial"> birthday&#8221; but contains a general provision that the actual benefit change will occur when the member becomes eligible for unreduced Social Security benefits.  The proposed amendment would add a definition of &#8220;Full Social Security Age&#8221; and use that term consistently to describe the age at which benefits will be reduced, so that the plan will be easier for members to understand.    </font><br></ul><b><font face="Arial">C.	Permitting members who are working part-time for FCPS after age 65 to draw their ERFC benefits and continue to work for FCPS part-time.</font></b><ul><br><font face="Arial">Currently, both</font><i><font face="Arial"> ERFC</font></i><font face="Arial"> and </font><i><font face="Arial">ERFC 2001</font></i><font face="Arial"> prohibit a deferred vested member from beginning ERFC payments while working in any capacity for Fairfax County Public Schools.  This proposed amendment would allow deferred vested members, who reach age 65 while working part-time for FCPS (substitute teachers, part-time teachers, etc,), to draw their deferred vested ERFC benefit and continue to work part-time for FCPS.  </font></ul><br><b><font face="Arial">D.  Clarifying the effect under the plan of small benefits that are paid as a lump-sum actuarial equivalent.</font></b><ul><br><font face="Arial">The plan authorizes the trustees to provide by regulation for payment of small benefits in the form of a lump-sum actuarial equivalent.  Such payments save the administrative costs of processing small checks.  (Currently, the trustees&#8217; regulation provides for lump-sum payment of benefits that are $100 or less per month, unless such a payment would cause hardship for the retiree.)  The plan contains rules about retirees who return to work for FCPS while receiving monthly benefits, but it does not contain rules about retirees who return to work for FCPS after receiving a lump-sum payment of a small pension.  The proposed amendment would provide that for the purposes of administering retirement benefits under </font><i><font face="Arial">ERFC</font></i><font face="Arial">, such a retiree would be treated the same as a member who withdrew his or her accumulated contributions upon leaving FCPS employment:  the retiree would not have to pay back the lump sum he or she had received; if the retiree worked in eligible employment, he or she would be enrolled in </font><i><font face="Arial">ERFC 2001</font></i><font face="Arial">; and upon retiring a second time the retiree would receive the amount of any new benefits he or she had earned or a refund of accumulated contributions for that period of re-employment.  </font></ul><br><b><font face="Arial">E.	Clarifying the plan&#8217;s compliance with federal law for members who return to FCPS after a period of military service.</font></b><ul><br><font face="Arial">Federal law defines the rights of employees who leave civilian employment for a period of military service and return to the same civilian employer within a certain time after the military service ends.  One of those rights is to redeposit (with interest) any retirement plan contributions that the employee withdrew in connection with the period of military service.  Federal law defines the amount of time that the employee must be given to make that redeposit.  </font><i><font face="Arial">ERFC 2001</font></i><font face="Arial"> contains provisions for a redeposit of service credit, but specifies a shorter period of time for that redeposit to be made.  The proposed amendment would clarify that a member returning from a period of military service will be permitted to make such a redeposit within the time permitted by federal law but would not affect the period for other members to redeposit their withdrawn contributions.  </font><br></ul><b><font face="Arial">F.  Clarifying that members must currently be in eligible employment to purchase service credit in </font></b><b><i><font face="Arial">ERFC.</font></i></b><ul><br><font face="Arial">Members of </font><i><font face="Arial">ERFC </font></i><font face="Arial">are permitted to</font><i><font face="Arial"> </font></i><font face="Arial">purchase service credit in the plan in order to qualify for a benefit sooner than they otherwise would or to increase their benefit amount.  Until recently federal law has permitted such a purchase to be made only while actively employed, and the plan did not separately state this rule.  Recent amendments to federal law permit purchases to be made at other times, but the Board of Trustees does not recommend liberalizing the plan&#8217;s practice.  The proposed amendment would maintain the plan&#8217;s current practice by adding plan language to the effect that service credit can be purchased only when the member is in eligible employment, as defined by the plan. </font><br></ul><b><font face="Arial">G.  Updating cross-references in the plan documents.</font></b><font face="Arial"> </font><ul><br><font face="Arial">The final category of changes in the proposed amendment would simply update cross-references in the plan documents to reflect changes in numbering in the Virginia Code and in the plan documents.</font><br></ul></ul><font face="Arial">Attachment:</font><font face="Arial">  Educational Employees of Fairfax County Defined Benefit Plan Amendment Number 13</font><a href="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/867GM526A342/$FILE/ERFC--Proposed%20Amendment%2013%20(final).pdf"><img src="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/867GM526A342/Body/0.358A?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="207" height="47" alt="ERFC--Proposed Amendment 13 (final).pdf" border="0"></a><br></div>
