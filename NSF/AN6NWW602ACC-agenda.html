			<p>-&nbsp;discuss the potential of acquiring additional technology for identifying active shooters in buildings,</p>

			<p>- assess existing policies regarding emergency preparedness drills and whether active shooter drills should be incorporated into existing practices, and</p>

			<p>- other additional measures as may be suggested by Safety and Security personnel, including recommendations for additional safety and security subject matter expertise.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Education Association&#39;s (NEA) Read Across America, now in its 20th year, is an annual reading motivation and awareness program that calls for every child in every community to celebrate reading on or around Dr. Seuss&#39;s birthday. This year&rsquo;s celebration is based on the theme, <em>&ldquo;Grab your Hat and Read with the Cat!&quot;</em> to encourage students to delve into books to learn as much as possible while becoming lifelong readers. In cities and towns across the nation, teachers, teenagers, librarians, politicians, actors, athletes, parents, grandparents, and others develop NEA&#39;s Read Across America activities to bring reading excitement to children of all ages. Governors, mayors, and other elected officials recognize the role reading plays in their communities with proclamations and floor statements. Athletes and actors issue reading challenges to young readers. Teachers and principals seem to be more than happy to dye their hair green or wear Seuss-inspired costumes if it boosts their students&#39; reading.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">School social workers are valuable members of multidisciplinary team serving schools, and providing a wide range of services to students, parents and faculty. School social workers are professionally trained to understand the needs of students who present with difficulties that interfere with learning and have expertise in many areas including mental health, human development and behavior; and how family dynamics affect student achievement. They foster positive relationships and create hope and opportunity for youth and families in need.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">School Social workers in Fairfax County Public Schools use their training, experience, and skills to provide services to children, families, and school staff members in the effort to remove personal and environmental obstacles to optimal student academic performance. Social workers are committed to helping every child achieve in school and become a self-sufficient, emotionally healthy, socially well-adjusted, productive member of society. </span></span></p>

In Virginia, the birthplace of Massive Resistance, the battle for integrated, equitable education for all children has been long and arduous and, at times, must have seemed hopeless. The courage and tenacity of the Fairfax County NAACP, throughout its 100-year history, have made all the difference and continue to benefit our school system and our community today. </span></span></span><u5:p></u5:p></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><em>Whereas,</em> from Columbine to Virginia Tech to Sandy Hook to Parkland, the lives of hundreds of students and school employees have been lost to the plague of gun violence[ii];</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><em>Whereas</em>, among high-income nations, 91 percent of children (under 15 years old) and 92 percent of youth (between 15 and 24 years old) who have been killed by bullets lived in the United States[iii];</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><em>Whereas</em>, nearly two dozen children are shot every day on average[iv] and more than 22 million children live in homes with a firearm in the United States[v];</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><em>Whereas</em>, Fairfax County Public Schools believes that the health and safety of our students and employees is our highest priority and that they will thrive in a vibrant, healthful, safe, enriching, and respectful environment[vi];</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><em>Whereas,</em> Fairfax County Public Schools has prioritized improving safety precautions to prevent gun violence incidents from occurring as well as mental health supports; and</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><em>Whereas</em> the responsibility for preventing gun violence incidents cannot be relegated to school districts alone;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><em>Therefore be it resolved </em>that the Fairfax County School Board calls upon the United States Congress and state legislatures, including the Virginia General Assembly, to prioritize the protection of students and school system employees by passing legislation that more effectively regulates access to firearms in the interest of public safety, funds public-health research on firearms-related issues, and advances mental health supports.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><b>School Board Action Required:</b> Decision</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><b>Related To: </b>School Board<b> </b>Regulation 8130.9, Local School Boundaries,&nbsp;Program Assignments, and School Closing</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><b>Key Points:</b></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) is considering a boundary adjustment to provide capacity relief to Jackson Middle School. Currently, Jackson has more than 1,400 students in a building with design capacity of 1,314 students. Thoreau Middle School, which is close in proximity to Jackson Middle School, recently completed a renovation that increased its design capacity to 1,395 students. Current enrollment at Thoreau is about 900. Enrollment at Thoreau Middle School is projected to have surplus available capacity in the future.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><b>Discussion: </b></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">The process for a standard boundary adjustment is outlined in FCPS Regulation 8130.9. Boundary scope meetings are the first step in the process. In June 2017, parents and guardians were invited to attend three boundary scope meetings to learn about the process and work in small groups to provide feedback to staff about what schools should be considered in the boundary study. Two community boundary study meetings were held on November 30 and December 4, 2017. After the presentation, community members worked in small groups to discuss the information and provide feedback on three options. The feedback was used to provide a recommendation of Option A to the School Board. Option A would reassign Marshall Road, Mosby Woods, and Oakton elementary schools, from Jackson Middle School to Thoreau Middle School, which would affect 309 students. With these reassignments, Thoreau Middle School would be at a capacity level of approximately 90 percent and Jackson Middle School would be at a capacity level of approximately 87 percent. This option would eliminate two existing split-feeders at the elementary-to-middle school level as all Oakton and Marshall Road Elementary school students would now go to Thoreau Middle School. Under Option A, Thoreau Middle School students would progress to Oakton in addition to Madison and Marshall high schools. This option would not create any problems for transportation services.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><b>Recommendation: </b></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">FCPS is recommending that the School Board approve a standard boundary adjustment of some Jackson Middle School students to Thoreau Middle School. Any approved boundary adjustment related to Jackson Middle School will not change the high school boundary. Some students who attend Oakton, Mosby Woods and Marshall Road elementary schools would be reassigned from Jackson Middle School to Thoreau Middle School, if the boundary adjustment Option A is approved.</span></span></p>
