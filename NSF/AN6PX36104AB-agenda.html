The Apple Federal Credit Union Education Foundation has generously funded the $500 award since 2007. The award is given to a junior or senior who demonstrates a continuous record of high morals, strong integrity, and good character, and who is recognized as a role model for students in Fairfax County Public Schools in day-to-day behavior.</span></span></span></span></p>

She is constantly there for anyone who needs emotional help&hellip;Her warm persona brightens the day for everyone she comes into contact with in our school.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="line-height:107%"><span arial="">With great dedication and a caring heart, volunteer service is very important to Rabia.

Rabia is very involved and engaged in Hayfield activities, encouraging STEM academics with the Technology Student Association, supporting the arts and creativity as a member of the National Art Honor Society, and advocating for her peers through the Student Government Association.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></p>

With the Muslim Youth Club, she has helped educate students and advance cultural awareness for Islam in today&rsquo;s society. She is trustworthy and responsible, serving as emotional support for her peers and helping them overcome challenges. As one of her nominators said, &ldquo;She inspires everyone around her to become a better person and to give back to the world.&rdquo; Her strength and influence reveal character traits all of our students can be inspired by. Rabia has earned and is truly deserving of the School Board Character Award. </span></span></span></span></p>

<div class="itembody"><p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Fairfax County Public Schools and the police departments of Fairfax County, Fairfax City and the Town of Herndon have enjoyed a mutually beneficial relationship for more than two decades. One of the hallmarks of this relationship is the School Resource Officer (SRO) program. SROs partner with school administrators to ensure safe, productive, and inviting school environments for students and staff by deterring crime, maintaining orderly schools, and preventing truancy.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">In addition, SROs provide relevant safety education programs to FCPS students. Many SROs also volunteer as student mentors through the Mentorworks Program, serving as trusted adults that students can depend on to assist them in making healthy and safe choices. Furthermore, SROs play a critical role in ensuring the success of the Alternative Accountability Program, a collaborative and community-oriented response to juvenile offenses that utilizes the principles of restorative justice to hold students accountable for their actions, while at the same time preventing formal Court involvement and satisfying the needs of victims.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Simply put, in order for students to be successful, they require safe and productive learning environments. Our SROs help provide these positive environments and also establish valued and trusted relationships with students and staff. </span></span></p>

<p style="margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;">On behalf of the Fairfax County School Board, it is an honor for me to recognize the students from Fairfax County Public Schools who won First Place Awards in 2018 Technology Student Association (TSA) Technosphere Competition!</span></span></p>

<p style="margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;">The Technology Student Association (TSA) is open to students who have currently enrolled in technology education courses or have completed courses in the past. TSA&rsquo;s membership includes over 150,000 middle and high school students in 2,000 schools spanning 48 states. TSA is supported by educators, parents and business leaders who believe in the need for a technologically literate society. Members learn through exciting competitive events, leadership opportunities and workshops.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;">Every spring, the Virginia Association of the Technology Student Association hosts its annual leadership conference, Technosphere. The Technosphere Conference is the highlight of the Virginia TSA year and provides an incredible opportunity for members to compete, lead, and learn through competitive events for middle and high school students, leadership workshops and other special events.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;">During Technosphere, members gain experience and insight through networking with other students, teachers, parents, and members of the business community. These interactions throughout Technosphere strengthen the goals of innovation and collaboration through science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. Members exercise their technical knowledge, leadership skills, and professionalism as they engage in competitive events, projects, and seminars. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;">This year, Fairfax County Public School students earned 20 first place awards at the TSA Technosphere competition! On behalf of the Fairfax County School Board, I would like to recognize the students and their teachers from Twain Middle School, Carson Middle School, Kilmer Middle School, West Potomac High School, Thomas Jefferson High School, Hayfield Secondary School, Chantilly High School, Oakton High School, and West Springfield High School for their outstanding work. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;">This achievement is a testament to your talent, dedication, and hard work. We wish you continued success and all the best in your future endeavors!</span></span></p>

<div class="itembody"><p>This evening, the Fairfax County School Board would like to congratulate the outstanding accomplishments of the Rising Phoenix Team which is comprised of students from four Fairfax County Public Schools, Cooper and Longfellow Middle Schools, and the Churchill Road and Spring Hill Elementary Schools.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In April, the Rising Phoenix Team showcased their robot at the <em>US News Workforce for Tomorrow</em> and the <em>USA Science and Engineering Festival</em> in Washington DC.&nbsp; This team was then invited to attend the <em>2018 VEX IQ Challenge </em>at the <em>VEX Robotics World Championship</em> in Louisville, Kentucky where they won the two highest awards, the Excellence and Teamwork Champion Awards.&nbsp; Rising Phoenix also won the Create Award for their exceptional innovative robot design, and were also inducted into the STEM Hall of Fame.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We would also like to congratulate parent and coach, Mr. Yun Li, who motivated and guided this team to their third consecutive win.&nbsp; The team worked hard to build and test their robot, and conduct STEM research on ethics in robotics.&nbsp; As community service, the team conducts workshops to encourage robotics in younger kids in some of our local libraries.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We congratulate Mr. Li and the Rising Phoenix Team for a job well done and wish you all the best in your future endeavors.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">The Office of Facilities Management (&ldquo;OFM&rdquo;) seeks to establish a job order contract, as authorized by the Virginia Public Procurement Act (the &ldquo;Act&rdquo;), to provide for hazardous materials removal services for substances such as asbestos and lead-based paint in FCPS buildings as requirements become known. Generally, an individual task order is valued at $5,000-$80,000 depending upon the scope of the project.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Because the aggregate dollar amount paid for services performed in a given year under such a contract is expected to exceed $250,000, Policy 5011.3 requires the School Board to award these contracts. Funding for the hazardous materials removal contracts is provided from the Major Maintenance Fund, as well as school and department Operating Funds.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
	<li value="23081"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">were opened May 23, 2018. Staff conducted a comprehensive review. The low bidder, Goel Services, Inc. has performed satisfactorily on previous contracts with the School Board, and OFM recommends Goel Services, Inc. as the primary contract award. The next low bidder, Waco, Inc. has performed satisfactorily on previous contracts with the School Board, and OFM recommends secondary contract award to Waco, Inc. The bids of Goel Services, Inc. and Waco, Inc. are within budget. The bid of JJPS, Inc. has been deemed non-responsive due to its error in calculating its total bid price, and due to its failure to furnish with its bid a copy of its Virginia asbestos license. The final bid tabulation is furnished below. </span></span></li>

Thus, the ACC also serves as a teacher recruitment tool for FCPS.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="line-height:103%">ACC is a one year program which is approved by the Virginia Department of Education for an alternative certificate in administration. At the conclusion of the program, participants receive a Pre K-12 Administration and Supervision endorsement on their Virginia teacher and educator&rsquo;s license. Approximately, 14-20 FCPS teachers enroll in the ACC each year. The 2018-19 school year will be the 14<sup>th</sup> year of operation for the ACC program in FCPS.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="line-height:103%">During the course of the program, ACC participants are mentored by experienced school administrators, and develop a project focused on improving student achievement in FCPS schools.

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="background: white;"><span style="line-height: normal;"><span style="vertical-align: top;"><span style="color: black;">The 2019 &ndash; 2020 Standard School Year Calendar was developed with a focus on instruction and learning time for students. While teaching and learning was the priority, a multitude of factors were considered and balanced during the development of the calendar. Following a survey of the FCPS community, a calendar committee was formed to assist in the development of the calendar. The committee was composed of representatives from a variety of internal and external constituent groups and it utilized the survey data to help create the proposed calendar.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
