	<br />
	March has been officially designated by the National Association for Music Education for the observance of Music In Our Schools Month, the time of year when music education becomes the focus of schools across the nation.&nbsp; Based on the 2013 theme, Music Education:&nbsp; Orchestrating Success, the month is designed to raise awareness of the importance of music education for all children - and to remind citizens that school is where all children should have access to music. It also is an opportunity for music teachers to bring their music programs to the attention of the school and the community and to display the benefits school music brings to students of all ages.</span></span></p>

<p>
	<br />
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">National Sleep Awareness Week, which takes place March 3-10, 2013, is an annual public education and awareness campaign to promote the importance of sleep. Sleep Awareness Week brings attention to the importance of adequate sleep for health and safety, and a reminder of sleep-related responsibilities, such as not driving while drowsy and parents ensuring that their children get the sleep they need to learn effectively. <span style="color: black;">The National Sleep Foundation suggests that healthy adults need 7-9 hours of sleep per day, and school-age children might require 10-11 hours of sleep.&nbsp; </span>The results of the National Sleep Foundation&rsquo;s 2013 <em>Sleep in America&reg;</em> poll show a compelling association between exercise and better sleep.</span></span></p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Key Points:</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">This agenda item is provided to review the current FY 2013 budget and to make revisions as necessary.&nbsp; The FY 2013 Third Quarter Budget Review reports on activity and requests that have been made since the School Board&rsquo;s Midyear Budget Review that was approved on December 20, 2012.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">A revenue adjustment for sales tax is recommended for the School Operating Fund.&nbsp; Based on current receipts, it is anticipated that sales tax revenue will exceed the projection included in the FY 2013 Approved Budget by $1.6 million. Sales tax revenue will continue to be monitored closely for the remainder of FY 2013.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Recommended School Operating Fund expenditure adjustments reflect a net decrease of $13.0 million from compensation, utilities, and vehicle fuel.&nbsp; A reduction of $9.8 million in compensation accounts is due to the return of 74.6 staffing reserve positions and reductions in employee benefit accounts.&nbsp; There are currently 79.6 positions remaining in the staffing reserve, and five positions will be left in the reserve to address any special education staffing needs that cannot be addressed with the use of substitutes until the end of the year.&nbsp; Based on the actual health and dental elections made by parent liaisons and multilingual interpreters and the impact of the open enrollment changes made by FCPS employees, a reduction in employee benefits is recommended.&nbsp; A reduction of $2.0 million in utilities is recommended based on a new contract for natural gas, and a reduction of $1.1 million is possible based on fuel expenditures to date.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">In total, in the School Operating Fund, this agenda recognizes increased revenue totaling $1.6 million and decreased expenditures totaling $13.0 million.&nbsp; After recognizing the requirement for the FY 2014 budgeted beginning balance, the FY 2013 Third Quarter adjustments result in $14.4 million available to be added to the FY 2014 beginning balance.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Changes to other School Board funds are detailed in the attachment. </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Recommendation</strong>:</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">That the School Board approve revenue and expenditure adjustments as reflected in the FY&nbsp;2013 Third Quarter Budget Review and as detailed in the agenda item.</span></span></p>
