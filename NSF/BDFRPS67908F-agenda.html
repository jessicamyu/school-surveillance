<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>State Championship Recognition</strong></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">On behalf of the Fairfax County School Board, I am honored to recognize the Lake Braddock Bruins for winning the Class 6 Baseball State Championship this past spring. On June 14, the Varsity Baseball Team played a double header, where they defeated Chesterfield County&rsquo;s James River High School in the semi-finals, and then defeated a cross-county rival Westfield High School for the championship.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Finishing the season with a 29-4 record, the Bruins&rsquo; hard work and dedication helped them clinch their first state title since 2012. Head Coach John Thomas credits a theme of toughness as a key factor for their success. The players focused on building strength during the off season and remained consistent and determined throughout the season. Thomas won the State&rsquo;s Coach of the Year award for his efforts in developing a team with expert talent and perseverance. Closing out the season with a state title is a great source of pride for the Lake Braddock Bruins and the entire FCPS community.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Congratulations to all of the players for their accomplishments and victory. We wish you the very best in your future athletic and academic endeavors.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">On behalf of the Fairfax County School Board, I am honored to recognize the Lake Braddock Bruins Girls Cross Country Team for winning the VHSL Class 6A Championship on Saturday, November 16th. This is their 4th 6A title in 5 years and 13th overall. In addition to the team members, I would also like to congratulate Coach Mike Mangan, Assistant Coaches Jason Switzer, Nils Lindenblad and Zach Hawkins.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">All of the girls who raced factored in the scoring on the challenging Great Meadows 5K course. Individually, Sophie Willis and Lexie Hague made the all-state team via their performance. I want to congratulate the entire team as well as their coaching staff. Closing out the season with a state title is a great source of pride for the Lake Braddock Bruins and the entire FCPS community.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Congratulations to all the players for their accomplishments and victory. We wish you the very best in your future athletic and academic endeavors.</span></span></p>

<div class="rightcol">3.06 Human Trafficking Awareness Month Resolution</div>
</div>
<div class="leftcol">Meeting</div>
<div class="rightcol">Jan 9, 2020 - Regular Meeting</div>
<div class="leftcol">Category</div>
<div class="rightcol">3. Meeting Opening - 7 p.m.</div>

<div class="rightcol">Presentation</div>
<div class="itembody"><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; WHEREAS,</strong></em>&nbsp;human trafficking remains a largely unperceived threat to the students of Fairfax County, misunderstood and under-appreciated by a majority of the community, despite its persistence and prevalence across the nation and in our county, still on track to eclipse drug trafficking by revenue generated in the near future, with growing evidence that criminal organizations are specifically targeting Northern Virginia as an especially lucrative market; and</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>WHEREAS,&nbsp;</strong></em>human traffickers are known to target not only middle and high school teens but even elementary school students, so that victims have been identified from every high school and multiple middle and elementary schools across the county, with teens and younger children stalked physically at locations such as shopping malls and bus stops and on-line through all social media, particularly those applications that offer anonymity; and</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>WHEREAS,&nbsp;</strong></em>new trafficking victims continue to come from a wide variety of ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds, and many students do not recognize the warning signs when they or their friends are being groomed and manipulated by new so-called &ldquo;friends&rdquo; until it is too late to escape, with victims trapped by threats of violence or exposure and often by physical abuse; and</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>WHEREAS,&nbsp;</strong></em>Fairfax County Public Schools&nbsp;continue to teach a widely admired teen sex trafficking prevention curriculum in grades six through twelve, which serves as a model for other jurisdictions and has made notable progress in raising awareness of the threat and steps students can take to mitigate it; and</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHEREAS</strong></em><em>,</em>&nbsp;student groups at an increasing number of Fairfax County high schools and middle schools have held campaigns to raise awareness about teen sex trafficking and activate thousands of teens, and as a direct result of these campaigns new leads have been brought to the attention of law enforcement authorities and victims have been rescued; and</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>WHEREAS,&nbsp;</strong></em>alongside these student groups, educators, parents, medical professionals, law enforcement officials, civic organizations, and the business community have all stepped forward to emphasize the importance of bringing awareness about teen sex trafficking to young people and desire to further mobilize students and others in the community to progress toward an environment where this crime is not tolerated and its victims receive the full support of the community;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED</strong></em>&nbsp;that the Fairfax County School Board joins the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in recognizing the month of January 2020 as Human Trafficking Awareness Month in Fairfax County and supports the efforts of all those who are seeking to eliminate human trafficking and its impact on our community.</p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="line-height: normal;"><span verdana="">Milestone Tower Limited Partnership IV (“Milestone”) has applied to locate a single wireless telecommunications facility (the “Facility”) at Herndon High School pursuant to Policy 8335.4 and Regulation 8335.5. Milestone has previously installed 26 of the 35 Facilities currently located on various FCPS school sites, performing satisfactorily.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="line-height: normal;"><span verdana="">FCPS Facilities staff processed Milestone’s application in accordance with the above Policy and Regulation, including the required involvement of the magisterial district and at-large School Board members then in office.

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="line-height: normal;"><span verdana="">The Herndon High School site is subject to certain proffered rezoning conditions that were recently amended and approved by the Board of Supervisors to permit the expansion and renovation of the school. In order to add Milestone's proposed Facility to the property, those proffered conditions must be amended. The application to amend the proffered conditions requires review by the Planning Commission and ultimately approval by the Board of Supervisors. To that end, Facilities staff has filed, on behalf of the School Board as the landowner, a Proffered Condition Amendment (”PCA”) application [Application No. 89-D-007-02] in order to amend the proffers previously approved for Herndon High School to allow the placement of Milestone's wireless telecommunication facility on the Herndon High School property. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="line-height: normal;"><span verdana="">In keeping with County land use policy, the landowner and the applicant (Milestone) also must submit a separate, signed Proffer Statement (a draft of which is attached) thirty days prior to the public hearing before the Board of Supervisors. Typically, such a Proffer Statement requires minor revisions as the PCA application is reviewed by County staff and by the Planning Commission in preparation for the Board of Supervisors’ public hearing. The final version of the Proffer Statement adopted by the Board of Supervisors will go into effect, superseding all prior drafts. The hearing before the Planning Commission is currently scheduled for February 12, 2020, with a hearing before the Board of Supervisors scheduled for February 25, 2020.</span></span></span></span></p>
