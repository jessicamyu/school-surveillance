Transportation</font></a><br><b><font face="Arial"> </font></b><br><b><font face="Arial">Key Points:</font></b><br><font face="Arial"> </font><ul><ul><font face="Arial">The Department of Facilities and Transportation Services (the &quot;Department&quot;) has planned  certain traffic flow and parking improvements at the Lorton Center administrative site, including an off-site drive aisle, to improve bus parking and circulation (the &quot;Project&quot;).</font><br><font face="Arial"> </font><br><font face="Arial">The Department has negotiated with an adjacent property owner, Inova Health Care Services (&quot;Inova&quot;), to convey to the School Board a temporary access easement and a grading and temporary construction easement (collectively, the &quot;Easements&quot;) across a portion of Inova's property adjacent to Lorton Center to allow construction of the drive aisle.  In the course of negotiating the Easements, the Department's surveyor/engineer discovered a small 0.031-acre triangle shaped parcel of land (the &quot;Property&quot;) located directly in the path of the proposed drive aisle at the common boundary of the Lorton Center parcel (Tax Map Parcel 107-4-((1))-74) and the two Inova parcels (Tax Map Parcels 107-4-((1))-75A and 80).  Neither Inova nor the School Board owns the Property.  The School Board needs to acquire the Property in order to construct the drive aisle and complete the Project.</font><br><font face="Arial"> </font><br><font face="Arial">A subsequent title report prepared by Walker Title, Inc. determined that the ownership status of the Property is unclear.  The Property was either improperly described or inadvertently omitted from legal descriptions in deeds which form the chain of title to the Inova parcels and the School Board's Lorton Center site.  </font><br><font face="Arial"> </font><br><font face="Arial">Because of these deed errors, Walker Title was unable to determine the true legal owner of the Property.  Since this parcel was omitted from the various conveyances that have occurred with the surrounding School Board and Inova properties, the title company determined that title likely is held by one of two different owners from the 1920s and 1930s, and/or their possible heirs.  Given the amount of time that has passed since the named parties would have held title, it is reasonable to assume that the heirs now hold title.  Also, identifying the owners is difficult in part because they sold all of their interests in the surrounding properties years ago.  Because of these ambiguities, the true owner is &quot;unknown.&quot;  It is on that basis that the School Board can proceed with condemnation without attempting to purchase the property through negotiations.  Pursuant to Va. Code Ann. § 25.1-204, no effort to purchase is required where the owner is &quot;unknown.&quot;</font><br><font face="Arial"> </font><br><font face="Arial">In its current state, the Property has no access and no material value to anyone.  The condemnation process will allow the School Board to take title to the Property and proceed with the Project.  A sum equal to the appraised value of the land, $1,350, will be deposited with the Circuit Court.  This compensation will be held by the Court on behalf of the true owners if and when they ever come forward.</font><br><font face="Arial"> </font><br><font face="Arial">The School Board has the authority to condemn this property pursuant to Va. Code § 22.1-127.  It is required by Va. Code Ann. § 15.2-1903(B) to hold a public hearing to approve the condemnation prior to initiating condemnation proceedings.</font></ul></ul><font face="Arial"> </font><br><b><font face="Arial">Recommendation:</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial"> </font></b><ul><ul><font size="4" face="Arial">That the School Board (i) determine that the Project (hereinafter defined) is a necessary public use and authorize its completion, (ii) authorize the acquisition of the Property (hereinafter defined) by condemnation or other means to allow construction of the Project and (iii) authorize the Chief Operating Officer to execute on behalf of the School Board all necessary documents to accomplish such acquisition, including, without limitation, a Certificate of Take, all as approved by School Board counsel.</font><i><font size="4" face="Arial">  </font></i></ul></ul><i><font face="Arial"> </font></i><br><font face="Arial"> </font><br><font face="Arial">Attachments:</font><ul><ul><font face="Arial"> </font></ul></ul><font face="Arial">		Minor Site Plan Showing Project</font><b><font face="Arial"><br>            </font></b><font face="Arial">Plat of Take Area<br>            Title Report<br>            Appraisal<br>            Proposed Resolution<br>            Draft Certificate of Taking No. 2009-1</font><p><font size="4"> </font><a href="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/8678P922A2E5/$FILE/MINOR%20SITE%20Plan.pdf"><img src="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/8678P922A2E5/Body/0.16EA?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="113" height="47" alt="MINOR SITE Plan.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/8678P922A2E5/$FILE/Lorton%20Center%20Certificate%20of%20Taking.pdf"><img src="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/8678P922A2E5/Body/0.2000?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="188" height="47" alt="Lorton Center Certificate of Taking.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/8678P922A2E5/$FILE/TitleReport.pdf"><img src="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/8678P922A2E5/Body/0.2A40?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="78" height="47" alt="TitleReport.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/8678P922A2E5/$FILE/Lorton%20Center%20Appraisal.pdf"><img src="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/8678P922A2E5/Body/0.31DA?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="136" height="47" alt="Lorton Center Appraisal.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/8678P922A2E5/$FILE/Lorton%20Center%20Condemnation%20Resolution.pdf"><img src="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/8678P922A2E5/Body/0.3E04?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="214" height="47" alt="Lorton Center Condemnation Resolution.pdf" border="0"></a><a href="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/8678P922A2E5/$FILE/ATTNN9H2.pdf"><img src="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/8678P922A2E5/Body/0.495E?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="83" height="47" alt="ATTNN9H2.pdf" border="0"></a><p></div>
