<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Key Points</strong>:</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The ERFC Board of Trustees is recommending technical amendments to the ERFC Defined Benefit Plan (<em>ERFC </em>and <em>ERFC 2001) </em>for the purpose of (1) clarifying that Member and Employer contributions will be paid for each month during which the Member received pay, in accordance with uniform and nondiscriminatory regulations adopted by the Trustees; and (2) identifying the default beneficiary for Service-Connected Death Benefits under <em>ERFC</em> if no Named Beneficiary survives the Member. Neither of the proposed changes is expected to affect the benefits payable under the Plan.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><u>Member and Employer Contributions</u>: The current plan documents provide that the Employer and each Member shall contribute a percentage of the Member&rsquo;s Salary during the Member&rsquo;s Eligible Employment. Both <em>ERFC</em> and <em>ERFC 2001</em> should be amended to clarify that Member and Employer contributions will be paid for each month during which the Member received pay, in accordance with uniform and nondiscriminatory regulations adopted by the Trustees. This amendment is necessary to conform to the changes under the Virginia Retirement System modernization project.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><u>Default Beneficiary</u>: The current <em>ERFC</em> plan document does not provide for a default beneficiary for Service-Connected Death Benefits if no Named Beneficiary survives the Member. Consistent with the default beneficiary rules for Death Benefits, <em>ERFC</em> should be amended to provide for a default beneficiary for Service-Connected Death Benefits.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Recommendation</strong>:</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">That the School Board approve Amendment 3 to <em>ERFC</em> and <em>ERFC 2001</em> for the purposes of (1) clarifying that Member and Employer contributions will be paid for each month during which the Member received pay, in accordance with uniform and nondiscriminatory regulations adopted by the Trustees; and (2) identifying the default beneficiary for Service-Connected Death Benefits under <em>ERFC</em> if no Named Beneficiary survives the Member.</span></span></p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Key Points:</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">During the 2012 session of the Virginia General Assembly, legislation was passed requiring all active participants of the Virginia Retirement System (VRS) to contribute toward the cost of retirement benefits. The legislation provides that localities and school systems may phase in employee contributions at a rate of 1% or more per year, and that the full phase in of a 5% contribution rate must be completed by July 1, 2016. Jurisdictions must provide corresponding increases to salaries to offset these employee contributions. Newly hired or rehired employees as of July 1, 2012, shall pay 5% of their salary immediately and shall not have their contributions phased in. The Board adopted a 2% employee contribution rate for employees for Fiscal Year 2013.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">At the May 23, 2013, regular business meeting of the Fairfax County School Board, the Board adopted the remaining 3% contribution for a total 5% employee contribution rate for current employees for Fiscal Year 2014. VRS requires all participating employers to execute the attached resolution documenting the agreed upon employee contribution rates. The resolution is binding and irrevocable.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Recommendation: </strong></span></span></p>

	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: verdana,sans-serif;">Willow Springs Elementary School (WSES) was constructed in 1991 with only a single point of entry for both motor vehicles and buses.&nbsp; Because Willow Springs is located along Braddock Road, the majority of students are transported by bus. For the past several years the school community has requested that a traffic light or a turning lane be constructed to help alleviate the congestion associated with the arrival and dismissal of students.&nbsp; WSES is an Advanced Academic Program center which increases the number of buses and motor vehicles.&nbsp; Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) has not been successful in the past in obtaining permission from the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) to install a traffic signal at the school.&nbsp; Last fall 2012, however, local political leaders advocated for this project to VDOT which agreed to permit the installation of a right turn lane and a signal light provided that FCPS fund the entire project.</span></span></span></p>
