The total cost of the field (including related site work and installation) is $795,671.29. SYC&#8217;s financial institution will deposit that amount with the School Board concurrent with the parties&#8217; execution of the Contribution &amp; Use Agreement, which has been negotiated by SYC and school system staff. In exchange, SYC will be afforded second priority use of the artificial turf field for an initial term of up to ten years, subordinate to the school&#8217;s use for its instructional program and to VHSL athletic uses as well as to certain revenue generating activities to provide funding assistance to the school for future, replacement field surfaces at this stadium.</font><br><br><font face="Arial">Following the execution of the Contribution and Use Agreement and SYC&#8217;s payment of $795,671.29, the contract for provision and installation of the field will be executed. Atlas Track &amp; Tennis has been selected to perform the installation (and related site work) in accordance with a cooperative procurement issued in 2004 by the Association of Educational Purchasing Agencies (AEPA), a national educational purchasing cooperative. This AEPA procurement has secured competitive pricing which is considered favorable by the Office of Design and Construction Services. The school system&#8217;s Office of Design and Construction will be responsible for construction contract administration and for inspection of the field improvement work. </font><br></ul><font face="Arial">		Attachment:</font><a href="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/867KXN2855A4/$FILE/WSHS%20MOA.pdf"><img src="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/867KXN2855A4/Body/0.1AD2?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="85" height="48" alt="WSHS MOA.pdf" border="0"></a><br><b><font face="Arial">  </font></b><br></div>

A key component of this effort involved engaging the community in a dialogue about its expectations and hopes for the public school system. Over a period of 10 weeks, the School Board held 33 community meetings that included small focus group meetings and &#8220;District Dialogues&#8221; in each magisterial district. </font><p><br><font face="Arial">On May 19, 2006, the Board held a strategic planning work session to review the feedback provided by the community on the achievement goals. Based on the input the Board received, those goals were further refined.  Once the goals are adopted, the Superintendent and staff will develop measures for implementing and monitoring the operational expectations and goals.
