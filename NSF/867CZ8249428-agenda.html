It includes a response to the School Board charge to the Committee, as well as the Committee&#8217;s recommendations to the School Board.</font></ul></ul><br><b><font face="Arial">KEY POINTS:</font></b><br><ul><ul><font face="Arial">The Committee report demonstrates the relationship of Adult &amp; Community Education to the School Board&#8217;s Strategic Goals. In addition, the Committee makes the following points:</font><div align="center"></div><b><font face="Arial">1.	Financial Status:</font></b><font face="Arial"> ACE is well managed and is operating in line with the 2006 Audit reports.  Enrollment has increased in fiscal year 2008 in a contracting economy. FY 08 enrollment is 9.9% higher than FY 07.  </font><br><br><b><font face="Arial">2.	Programming:</font></b><font face="Arial"> ACE continues to explore how programs may be responsive to the needs of the community. A new class offering area is the &#8216;Green Movement&#8217; as noted in the inside cover of the current ACE catalog.  ACE continues to be an incubator for education classes. The </font><i><font face="Arial">Everyday Green Lecture</font></i><font face="Arial"> series has already generated interest, and ACE is considering course programs which will empower citizens of Fairfax County to reduce their carbon footprint. </font><br><br><b><font face="Arial">3.	Recognition</font></b><font face="Arial">: The ACE Volunteer Learning Program was recognized and received Fairfax County&#8217;s 2008 Volunteer Service Award for Outstanding Volunteer Program.  This award was presented at Volunteer Fairfax&#8217;s annual awards event on April 24, 2008. The VLP, established in 1975, recruits, trains, and oversees tutors who work with Adult Learners in GED preparation, Woodson Adult High School, and the National External Diploma program. In addition, VLP partners with the Juvenile Courts, and the VLP tutors help court-involved juveniles to complete high school at the Juvenile Detention Center and other alternative school settings. </font><br><font face="Arial">	</font><br><font face="Arial">Mrs. Jane Cruz, administrator of the Adult High School Completion Programs, was named Educator of the Year in 2008 by the Martin Luther King, Jr., Cultural Foundation. </font><br><br><font face="Arial">ACE&#8217;s website was recognized by an international organization, the Learning Resources Network, as an exemplary site for community education programs.</font><br><br><b><font face="Arial">4.	Support by Corporate Donors</font></b><font face="Arial">: Corporate Sponsors including Capital One and Access National Bank are making grants to ACE and through the ACE Foundation to support students with financial need. These corporate sponsors recognize the value ACE programs provide to Fairfax County citizens. </font><br><br><b><font face="Arial">5.	Edsall Park Facility:</font></b><font face="Arial"> ACE is continuing to operate at the Edsall Park facility as it continues to undergo renovation. ACE moved into the Edsall Park facility in October 2006 with construction projected to be completed in 2009. </font><br></ul></ul><b><font face="Arial">OPTIONS:</font></b><br><ul><ul><font face="Arial">The Committee makes the following recommendations to the Board:</font><div align="center"><font face="Arial">	</font></div><font face="Arial">1.	Fairfax County School Board Strategic Goals do not include any specific language addressing adult learning. We ask that the 	Strategic Goals include adult learners. </font><br><br><font face="Arial">2.	Proceed expeditiously with the new adult education facility approved by the voters for West County. </font><br><br><font face="Arial">3.	Willston Center is currently a facility near Seven Corners owned by Fairfax County rather than FCPS.  An evaluation of ADA 	(American with Disabilities Act of 1990) compliance should be done along with a review of the overall facility for general 	maintenance and upkeep. </font><br><br><font face="Arial">4.	With the proposed reduction in summer school students, beginning in July 2008, FCPS should evaluate the continuing support required for the at-risk students attending high school completion programs, ESOL classes, and apprenticeship programs. </font><br><br><font face="Arial">5.	Evaluate categorizing Woodson Adult High School (WAHS) as an individual school, similar to our Alternative High Schools, rather than as a program as it is currently. WAHS has grown dramatically in recent years &#8211; both in overall enrollment and in enrollment of school-age adults. Yet unlike all other schools, WAHS&#8217;s resources do not rise to meet the needs of increasing enrollments. Over 400 individual students are enrolled in a fiscal year with 120 graduating in FY 07 and 127 in FY 06. There has been a 20% increase in enrollment in FY 08 from FY 07 and a 43% increase from FY 06.  Woodson Adult High School is fully accredited, meeting Annual Yearly Progress (AYP).</font><br></ul></ul><b><font face="Arial">RECOMMENDATION:</font></b><br><br><font face="Arial">The staff recommends acceptance of the Committee&#8217;s report and recommendations.</font><br><br><br><font face="Arial">Attachment: Adult and Community Education Advisory Committee Report to the School Board</font><a href="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/867CZN24948E/$FILE/ACEAdvisoryAnnualReportFY08.pdf"><img src="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/867CZN24948E/Body/0.1C02?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="177" height="47" alt="ACEAdvisoryAnnualReportFY08.pdf" border="0"></a><br></div>
