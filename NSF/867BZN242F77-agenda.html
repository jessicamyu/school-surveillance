Approximately 75% of FCPS&#8217;s total funding is derived from locally generated revenues as appropriated by the Board of Supervisors. Those present agreed to sponsor a joint resolution pledging to cooperate fully in a detailed review of County lines of business and school programs and operations to identify opportunities for streamlining, consolidations, and eliminations, and to identify multi-year opportunities for cost reductions and savings to address the potential deficits. Each Board will take formal action to approve the resolution at a future business meeting (the School Board&#8217;s approval is scheduled for September 4). </font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br><br></font><font size="4" face="Arial">The County and Fairfax County Public Schools have scheduled and will jointly sponsor over 20 community meetings to gather feedback from their constituents on the budget. </font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br><br></font><b><font size="4" face="Arial">KEY POINTS:</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br><br></font><font size="4" face="Arial">At the July 19, 2008, School Board retreat, there was discussion to establish an ad hoc committee to review FCPS programs and operations with the Superintendent and the staff. This review is recognized by the School Board and Superintendent as a necessary and important task. The outcome will inform the Superintendent&#8217;s proposed budget for FY2010. The program review will also inform the School Board&#8217;s expenditure and revenue decisions that will be reflected in the advertised budget, including the revenue that will be requested from the Board of Supervisors. The program review will be focused on sustaining high-quality educational services to the greatest extent possible in a period of fiscal austerity, while also meeting Federal and state mandates, many of which are unfunded. The results of the reviews by FCPS and the County will be the subject of a subsequent joint meeting on November 14, 2008. </font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br><br></font><font size="4" face="Arial">The Program Review Committee (PRC), if its formation is approved by the School Board, will first work with the Superintendent to design a program review process that ensures a thorough review of the cost effectiveness of each program and operation under his direction.  The PRC will then support the full-Board&#8217;s understanding of the Program Review results and Superintendent&#8217;s ultimate recommendations; and will identify, as appropriate, selected programs for a more detailed review by the PRC and/or School Board. </font><br><br><font size="4" face="Arial">All PRC meetings will be public work sessions.

The Board concluded that 1) additional information was needed and that 2) the Board would consider the scope of the fall boundary studies at its regular meeting scheduled for September 4, 2008, instead of an informal consensus vote at a work session. </font><br><br><font face="Arial">	At the July 18, 2008, retreat, the School Board used the Trego Education Forum Decision Analysis process to develop criteria for consideration in selecting schools to be included in the boundary studies for elementary schools at the Coppermine and Laurel Hill sites.   Staff was directed to utilize these criteria to assist in an analysis of schools to be considered for the 2008 fall boundary studies. </font><br><br><b><font face="Arial">KEY POINTS:	</font></b><ul><ul><br><font face="Arial">The purpose of the 2008 fall studies is to establish attendance areas for new elementary schools at the Coppermine and Laurel Hill sites, both of which are under construction and scheduled to open in fall 2009.  Staff has</font><b><font face="Arial"> </font></b><font face="Arial">reviewed the surrounding elementary schools for both sites and provided an assessment of capacities, enrollments and projections. </font><br><br><font face="Arial">In order to provide information to assist the Board in the determination of which schools should be included in the boundary studies for schools at Coppermine and Laurel Hill, the Board asked staff to assess a group of schools against the 12 criteria, developed at the July 18 retreat.  Although many of these factors are not subject to precise measurement, staff has created the numerical rankings, using available data and their best judgment.</font><br><br><font face="Arial">Staff&#8217;s analysis using the 12 criteria is provided in the attached matrix, &#8220;Analysis of Factors Impacting Selection of Schools for Boundary Study&#8221;. </font><br><font face="Arial">	</font><br><font face="Arial">	As staff applied criteria to the Coppermine study, they recommend that Fox Mill Elementary School not be included because of their involvement in a recent boundary study; staff does recommend that Hutchison Elementary School be included in the study because of its available capacity.</font><br><br><font face="Arial">The additional capacity analysis information requested by the Board is contained in the attached countywide capacity analysis; this analysis will be updated with the 2008 Fall CIP to include new 5 year projections.  </font></ul></ul><br><b><font face="Arial">OPTIONS:</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial">	</font></b><font face="Arial">1) Approve staff&#8217;s initial recommendation; </font><br><font face="Arial">	2) Amend staff&#8217;s recommendation to reflect a different group of schools to be involved in the study. </font><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><b><font face="Arial">RECOMMENDATION:	</font></b><br><ul><ul><font face="Arial">1) That the School Board adopts the following criteria for the purpose of selecting schools to be included in the boundary studies for the new elementary schools at the Coppermine and Laurel Hill sites:  help balance enrollment; accommodate projected enrollment; have geographic proximity; provide socio-economic and ESOL balance; adhere to core capacity; respect man-made and natural barriers; accommodate current enrollment; reduce boundary lines; minimize split neighborhoods; minimize split feeder assignments; maximize program stability; and minimize additional capital/operating costs; further move that the Board shall make the final designation of schools to be included in the boundary study, considering not only these criteria, but also any other factors that will contribute to the improved operational efficiency and instructional effectiveness of the school system, pursuant to Policy 8130, Local School Boundaries, Program Assignments and School Closings.</font><font face="Arial">  </font><br><br><font face="Arial">2) That the School Board directs the Superintendent to conduct a study of Floris, Herndon, Hutchison, McNair, and Oak Hill Elementary Schools and develop preliminary boundary options for populating the new elementary school at the Coppermine site, pursuant to Policy 8130, Local School Boundaries, Program Assignments and School Closings.</font><font face="Arial"> </font><font face="Arial">  </font></ul></ul><font color="#000080" face="Arial">	</font><br><b><font face="Arial">	</font></b><font face="Arial">3) That the School Board directs the Superintendent to conduct a study of Gunston, Halley, Lorton Station, Newington Forest, and Silverbrook Elementary Schools and develop preliminary boundary options for populating the new elementary school at the Laurel Hill site pursuant to Policy 8130, Local School Boundaries, Program Assignments and School Closings.</font><font face="Arial"> </font><font face="Arial"> </font><br><font color="#000080" face="Arial">	</font><br><br><font face="Arial">	Attachments:	1.
