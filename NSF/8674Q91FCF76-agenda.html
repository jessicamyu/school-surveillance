	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><b><u>Laura Ashley Piper Scholarship - History</u></b><br />
	<br />
	Laura Ashley Piper served as student representative to the Fairfax County School Board from 1986 to 1987. This outstanding student, talented athlete, and exceptional leader graduated from Robinson Secondary School and the Air Force Academy and was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the Air Force. She was killed in action over northern Iraq in April 1994. To honor Laura Ashley Piper&rsquo;s strong commitment to student participation and to recognize her high standards of achievement and involvement and her willingness to continually accept responsibility throughout her lifetime, the School Board of Fairfax County has established the annual $1,000 Laura Ashley Piper Scholarship.<br />
	<br />
	Each year, every high school may nominate one senior student who exemplifies the &ldquo;attributes of personal excellence and commitment to student government&rdquo; of Lt. Piper. A committee from the Office of School Counseling Services, Department of Instructional Services, considers the nominees. There is an engraved plaque in the School Board Office with each winner&rsquo;s name.</span></p>

	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The School Board Character Award, first presented in June 2002, was established by the Student Advisory Council and 2000-2001 Student Representative to the School Board Chris Giovarelli to be presented to a junior or senior who demonstrates a continuous record of high morals, strong integrity, and good character, and who is recognized as a role model for other Fairfax County Public Schools students in his or her day-to-day behavior.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br />

<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">K.E. Scarry, a senior at Oakton High School, has demonstrated the qualities and leadership envisioned by the SAC and Mr. Giovarelli when they established this award.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

	</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">As an 8<sup>th</sup> grader, K formed &ldquo;Sunshine for Soldiers&rdquo; to support troops overseas, in training camps, and in hospitals, sending care packages and cards, letters, and e-mails so that servicemen and women knew how much they are appreciated.&nbsp; Her organization collected over 13,000 items to support over 1,600 troops.</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br />

<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Beginning with her freshman year, K became involved in Best Buddies, taking on increasingly active leadership roles, and currently serving as its president.&nbsp; Best Buddies is dedicated to enhancing the lives of those with intellectual and developmental disabilities by creating one-on-one friendships with nondisabled students, focusing on abilities, not disabilities.&nbsp; Under K&rsquo;s leadership, Oakton has become a more inclusive and welcoming environment for students of all abilities.</span></span></p>

	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Additionally, K is an outstanding student, athlete, and community leader, coaching soccer and baseball Special Olympics teams and traveling with her church group on numerous mission trips.&nbsp; Her positive attitude and enthusiasm make her one whom other students willingly follow.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br />
	</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">K is a true leader, walking the walk in serving others and making her school and local communities better places.&nbsp; As one nominator wrote, &quot;Not only is she a dedicated and creative volunteer but her kindness, concern, and respect for others have greatly enhanced our program and our community. &nbsp;Recently, one of our program participants told me his mother said that the world is a better place because of this young woman.&quot;</span></span></p>

<ul>
	In recognition of the fact that employees are not receiving an increase in financial compensation in FY 2011, the School Board would like to provide early release on two days to give families and employees an early start to the winter break (December 22, 2010) and the Memorial Day weekend (May 27, 2011). This early release will be similar to the early release day before the Thanksgiving holiday, and principals and program managers are encouraged to release both instructional and support employees where program operations permit. If this recommendation is approved, the 2010-2011 school calendar will be revised accordingly and the community will be notified in various ways (to include a Keep in Touch message).

			Herndon High School and its community desire to have synthetic turf installed on its main stadium and practice fields. There are two cooperative purchasing contracts for synthetic turf available to the School Board and pricing was requested from:
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<ul>
							&middot; General Sports Venue/Astroturf (U.S. Communities contract; Astroturf manufacturer)
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<ul>
							&middot; Atlas Tracks, Inc. (Association of Educational Purchasing Agencies contract; FieldTurf Tarkett manufacturer)
						</ul>

				</ul>
			</li>
			Atlas Tracks, Inc. provided the most favorable pricing for this project.

		<ul>
			Funding will be provided by the Board of Supervisors (Department of Recreation Services), the Fairfax County Park Authority, Herndon High School Sports Booster Club, Herndon Youth Soccer, Inc., and Herndon Optimists (collectively, the &ldquo;Contributing Parties&rdquo;).

None of the proposed changes is expected to affect the benefits payable under the Plan.</font></ul><font face="Arial"> </font><br><font face="Arial">A summary of the proposed amendments is provided below. </font><br><font face="Arial"> </font><ul><ul><b><font face="Arial">A.  Simplifying the administration of benefits for certain members who have credit for  service before July 1, 1988</font></b></ul></ul><font face="Arial"> </font><ul><ul><font face="Arial">The benefit structure in </font><i><font face="Arial">ERFC </font></i><font face="Arial">was substantially amended in 1988 because of changes in the benefits provided by VRS.  One benefit provision &#8211; an alternative calculation - was adopted at that time to preserve the value of certain benefits that members had expected under the pre-1988 plan.  Now, more than 20 years later, the formula under the amended plan consistently produces a higher amount of benefits.  In retirement calculations performed for retiring members over the past two and a half years, the alternative calculation has not produced a higher benefit for even one retiree.  Analysis of the formula, moreover, demonstrates that it is extremely unlikely that this alternative calculation will produce a higher benefit for any future retirees. In connection with the recent automation of benefit calculations, the Trustees recommend amending section 5.02(b)(3) of the </font><i><font face="Arial">ERFC </font></i><font face="Arial">Plan document to streamline this administrative function by removing the alternative calculation.  </font></ul></ul><font face="Arial"> </font><ul><b><font face="Arial">	B.  Clarifying rules for purchase of service credit in </font></b><b><i><font face="Arial">ERFC</font></i></b><br><b><i><font face="Arial"> </font></i></b><ul><font face="Arial">Members of </font><i><font face="Arial">ERFC</font></i><font face="Arial"> (but not </font><i><font face="Arial">ERFC 2001</font></i><font face="Arial">) are permitted to purchase service credit for work that is not otherwise credited in the Plan.  Under rules adopted by the Trustees, these purchases are more costly as a member approaches retirement; a purchase made less than five years before actual retirement is subject to a substantial monetary penalty both to encourage earlier purchases and to give the Plan a longer period to invest the proceeds of a purchase before the Plan begins to pay out benefits to the member who purchased the credit.  When a member makes such a purchase with the intent of waiting five years before retiring but later changes his or her plans and retires sooner, the amount of the credit is recalculated so that the penalty is appropriately charged to the member.  The Trustees recommend amending section 11.01(b) of the </font><i><font face="Arial">ERFC </font></i><font face="Arial">Plan document to clarify that the Plan will not refund the purchase price of the service credit to a member whose purchase is subject to such a recalculation.  </font><br><font face="Arial"> </font></ul><b><font face="Arial">	C.  Clarifying the rules for leaving accumulated contributions on deposit</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial"> </font></b><ul><font face="Arial">Members who leave FCPS positions that are covered by </font><i><font face="Arial">ERFC</font></i><font face="Arial"> or </font><i><font face="Arial">ERFC 2001</font></i><font face="Arial"> have the option of leaving their member contributions on deposit, and thus preserving their rights under the Plan in the event they return to covered employment at a later date.  If the member was not vested in the Plan and ten years passes without the member returning to covered employment or requesting a refund of the member contributions, the Plan provides that the contributions shall become the property of the Plan, subject to refund (but without any additional interest) if the member or the member&#8217;s estate later requests the refund.  The Trustees recommend amending the ten-year rule, in Section 12.02 of the </font><i><font face="Arial">ERFC </font></i><font face="Arial">Plan and in Section 7.02 of </font><i><font face="Arial">ERFC 2001</font></i><font face="Arial">, in order to clarify that it operates only if there is a single continuous ten-year absence from covered employment. </font><br><font face="Arial"> </font><br><b><font face="Arial">D.

(This rule does not apply in </font><i><font face="Arial">ERFC</font></i><font face="Arial">, because that is a closed Plan; a member returning to covered employment after withdrawing contributions from </font><i><font face="Arial">ERFC </font></i><font face="Arial">is not permitted to re-enter </font><i><font face="Arial">ERFC.</font></i><font face="Arial">)  The Trustees recommend amending Section 7.04 of </font><i><font face="Arial">ERFC 2001</font></i><font face="Arial"> to clarify that the member must make this redeposit on his or her </font><u><font face="Arial">first</font></u><font face="Arial"> return to covered employment after withdrawing the member contributions.</font><br><font face="Arial"> </font><br><b><font face="Arial">E.

These limits were adopted to protect the Plan, the Trustees, and the School Board from claimants seeking additional benefits many years after benefit payments had begun, and to provide a definite time period where the Virginia Code is unclear about the applicable time limits. The Trustees recommend amending Section 16.17 of the </font><i><font face="Arial">ERFC </font></i><font face="Arial">Plan and Section 11.15 of </font><i><font face="Arial">ERFC 2001 </font></i><font face="Arial">to clarify that in cases where the Plan has made erroneous benefit payments, the Trustees can file a suit (if necessary) to recover that money within two years after they determine that such an erroneous payment occurred.</font></ul></ul><b><font face="Arial"> </font></b><br><font face="Arial"> </font><br><b><font face="Arial">Recommendation:</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial"> </font></b><ul><ul><font face="Arial">That the School Board approve Amendment 16 to the ERFC Benefit Plan (</font><i><font face="Arial">ERFC and ERFC 2001</font></i><font face="Arial">) for the purpose of simplifying administration and clarifying the application of certain administrative rules without changing benefits.  </font><i><font face="Arial"> </font></i><font face="Arial"> </font></ul></ul><font face="Arial">Attachment: Educational Employees of Fairfax County Defined Benefit Plan Proposed Amendment Number 16  </font><a href="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/8674SK1FD5BF/$FILE/ATTVAFGF/Proposed%20Amendment%2016.pdf"><img src="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/8674SK1FD5BF/Body/0.1FC6?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="145" height="47" alt="Proposed Amendment 16.pdf" border="0"></a></div>

	<b><font face="Arial">Key Points:</font></b><br />
	<br />
	<font face="Arial">The Virginia General Assembly, in its 2010 session passed legislation creating a separate retirement plan for employees hired on or after July 1, 2010 (hereafter referred to as &ldquo;Plan 2&rdquo; employees). The legislation amended Virginia Code to provide that Plan 2 employees will pay their 5 percent member contribution and that, local public school boards may pick-up, in whole or in part (in 1 percent increments), the 5 percent member contribution as an additional benefit. </font><br />
	<br />
	<font face="Arial">Strategically, we do not wish to segment the workforce, effectively reducing starting salaries for newly hired VRS eligible employees by 5 percent. Therefore, the recommendation is to continue to pick up the employee contribution for all VRS eligible employees. This election is made by School Board resolution and is revocable and can be revisited annually if desired.</font><br />

Staff commends and compliments all the members of the ad hoc planning group, particularly the leadership, including the co-chairs and sub-committee chairs, for their commitment to the work, the resulting analysis and creative solutions. Staff is especially grateful for the collegial spirit with which the committee engaged staff and for their patience as staff worked to support this first ad hoc planning process. The ideas bought forward by the committee provided new planning perspectives to staff in consideration of the focus issues: overcrowding in the region and renovation challenges with Clifton ES. </font><br />
	<br />
	<font face="Arial">The updated staff report reaffirms the topographic and access challenges associated with renovating Clifton. One of the major, but not the only, challenge is the absence of public water and the water quality issues of the existing wells. </font><br />
	<br />
	<font face="Arial">Unique characteristics of the Clifton Elementary School site will result in higher than normal renovation costs. Staff estimates that a full scope renovation of Clifton ES will cost about $35,287 per student which is significantly higher than similar renovations of other FCPS schools which cost about $22,805 per student. This cost factor is magnified due to the fact that the most recent projections indicate that enrollment is declining at Clifton Elementary School with an enrollment of 298 students projected for School Year 2015-16.</font><br />
	<br />
	<font face="Arial">Should the School Board decide to close Clifton Elementary School, the building can be kept by the School Board in case of future unanticipated need. In the meantime, the School Board could consider leasing the building at a very minimal cost to the Town of Clifton to address that community&rsquo;s understandable concerns about having a place to meet and gather. Other adaptive reuse options for the building and site could also be considered. </font><br />
	<br />
	<font face="Arial">The FCPS educational specifications were developed to ensure a rich and appropriate educational environment at each of our schools. Staff does not believe that we should do a reduced scope renovation at Clifton Elementary School as a means to reduce cost unless the School Board is prepared to make similar reductions at all schools for future renovations. If existing excellent student achievement is a criterion by which to make a decision to reduce scope, we have a number of upcoming renovations for consideration.</font><br />
	<br />
	<font face="Arial">FCPS has a history of closing schools when enrollments become too low or when site and building challenges do not allow renovations to bring a building up to current educational specifications or when the costs to do so become prohibitive. Wilton Woods, Pine Ridge, Masonville, Walnut Hill and Virginia Hills were all schools that were closed by action of the School Board. More recently, the School Board decided to move Graham Road from its current location to the Devonshire site due to constraints and costs associated with the existing site. </font><br />
	<br />
	<b><font face="Arial">Options:</font></b><font face="Arial"><br />
	</font><br />
	<font face="Arial">Staff believes that the only viable option to closing Clifton Elementary School is to renovate that school and construct additions at several schools within the study area. Staff does not support keeping Clifton open and building a new school as this would be costly for both the capital program and for the operating fund.<br />
	</font><br />
	<font face="Arial">The staff and the ad hoc committee reports offer different options to address overcrowding in the area elementary schools and to address the potential renovation of Clifton ES. The sub-committee reports outlining other solutions with pros and cons of the options is attached along with the participation results of the community outreach meetings.</font><br />
	<br />
	<b><font face="Arial">Recommendations:</font></b><br />
	<br />
	<font face="Arial">Staff recommends that the School Board accept the Southwestern Regional Planning Committee Phase II report and the updated staff report.</font><br />
	<br />
	<font face="Arial">Staff is recommending that based upon the information contained in these two reports that the School Board (1) build a new elementary school on the Liberty Middle School site; (2) build one or more additions on elementary schools in that region; (3) conduct a boundary study based upon the new school, the addition(s), and potential program moves; (4) close Clifton Elementary School upon completion of the new elementary school.</font><br />
	<br />
	<font face="Arial">Should the School Board decide to renovate Clifton Elementary School, staff recommends that it be a complete renovation based upon the FCPS educational specifications. Furthermore, staff would recommend that additions be built on 2 or more elementary schools in the region to provide capacity to provide relief to overcrowding and conduct a boundary study based upon these additions and potential program moves.<br />
