		<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">National Volunteer Week is about inspiring, recognizing, and encouraging people to seek out imaginative ways to engage in their communities. It&rsquo;s about demonstrating to the nation that by working together, in unison, we have the fortitude to meet our challenges and accomplish our goals. National Volunteer Week is about taking action, encouraging individuals and their respective communities to be at the center of social change&mdash;discovering and actively demonstrating their collective power to foster positive transformation.</span></span></p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">National Library Week is a national observance sponsored by the American Library Association and libraries across the country each April. &nbsp;It is a time to celebrate the contributions of our nation&#39;s libraries and librarians and to promote library use and support. All types of libraries - school, public, academic and special - participate.&nbsp; This year, National Library Week will be observed&nbsp;April 10-16 with the theme, &quot;Libraries Transform.&rdquo; </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">School Library Month is the American Association of School Librarians&#39; celebration of school librarians and their programs. Every April school librarians are encouraged to create activities to help their school and local community celebrate the essential role that strong school library programs play in a student&#39;s educational career.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The School Board welcomes this opportunity to commend Fairfax County Public Schools&rsquo; librarians and to express its gratitude for the energy, knowledge, and vision that they tirelessly and unselfishly provide to the school system.</span></span></p>

	<u><strong>Month of the Military Child</strong></u></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">April is the Month of the Military Child.&nbsp; It is a time to recognize our military and veteran-connected students for their service and sacrifice. Military kids sacrifice and serve our country in their own way.&nbsp; Here in Fairfax County, we are extremely fortunate to have 8,066 students who are part of a military family as well as part of our Fairfax County Public Schools family.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Military-connected children and youth live with numerous challenges presented by frequent moves, parental deployments, and a host of life transitions that include reintegration and dealing with profoundly changed parents. <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">The following are just a few of the challenges military children face:&nbsp; moving and starting over on an average of every 1-3 years, attending 6-9 different schools from kindergarten through 12th grade, and multiple deployments of a parent.&nbsp; Throughout all of this, military children are resilient and patriotic.&nbsp; They know first-hand what it feels like to be the new kid, so they are usually the first one to welcome a new student to school.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Celebrating the Month of the Military Child provides a powerful opportunity to raise awareness and build support to help these children meet the unique challenges they face! It is an opportunity to recognize and thank military children and youth for their heroism, character, courage, sacrifices and continued resilience.</span></span></p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">In July 2015, the School Board approved Ignite, the strategic plan for Fairfax County Public Schools, which represents the cooperative work of the School Board and Leadership Team, with significant community input, to create a long term plan for continuous improvement. At the core of this plan is the FCPS Portrait of a Graduate. The Ignite Plan contains four strategic goals: Student Success, Caring Culture, Premier Workforce, and Resource Stewardship. This school year, 2015-2016, marks the first year of implementation of the Strategic Plan.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The School Board is to receive quarterly updates/reports on the Strategic Plan, focused on the work accomplished and the results received. In addition, the report will outline major Strategic Plan activities for the coming year that are designed to address areas in need of improvement. This presentation and report will provide an update on the monitoring metrics and current work that support Goal 2, Caring Culture.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The following are the three overarching strategies and the desired outcomes for Goal 2, Caring Culture:</span></span></p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Fairfax County Water Authority (&quot;FCWA&quot;) has asked that the School Board grant a water main easement and associated temporary construction easements at Groveton Elementary School (the &quot;Property&quot;) in connection with its South Kings Highway Transmission Main project (the &quot;Project&quot;).&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left:27.35pt;">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The Office of Design and Construction has reviewed the proposal and has determined that (i) the requested easements will have no negative impact on the operation of the school site and (ii) FCWA&#39;s proposed improvements will provide direct benefit to Groveton Elementary School in increased water pressure, as well as additional asphalt paving in the school&rsquo;s bus lane, all of which will constitute appropriate compensation for the easements. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left:27.35pt;">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The requested easements extend through the Property from the Harrison Lane right-of-way on the eastern frontage of the Property, westward to the southern terminus of Amlong Avenue, as shown on the easement plat.&nbsp; Upon completion of the Project, FCWA will abandon and quitclaim to the School Board the existing water line easements at Groveton Elementary School.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Key Points</strong>:&nbsp; The School Board does not tolerate unethical behavior and protects those who report allegations of suspected activities of wrong doing.&nbsp; FCPS has existing regulations that direct the Superintendent&rsquo;s office as well as the Office of Auditor General to execute and enforce actions that protect the Division against unethical behavior.&nbsp; These two proposed school board policies memorialize the School Board&rsquo;s current positions on fraud and anti-retaliation.&nbsp; Each attached, proposed school board policy references the corresponding regulations.</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The policy on Fraud, Waste and Abuse defines <em>waste</em> and <em>abuse</em>, which correspond to the fraud, waste and abuse hotline. These definitions will be reflected in the revisions to the corresponding regulations for reporting and investigating fraud, waste and abuse by the offices of Auditor General, Division Counsel, Human Resources, Risk Management and other &nbsp;FCPS offices.&nbsp; The policy on Protection against Retaliation akin to a &ldquo;whistleblower&rdquo; policy, and coordinates the purpose and responsibility of the offices of Division Counsel and Human Resources.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Recommendation</strong>:&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The audit committee and the auditor general recommend adoption of&nbsp; two new school board policies which reflect and reinforce the current practices and corresponding FCPS regulations.</span></span></p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">In July 2015, the School Board approved Ignite, the strategic plan for Fairfax County Public Schools, which represents the cooperative work of the School Board and Leadership Team, with significant community input, to create a long term plan for continuous improvement. At the core of this plan is the FCPS Portrait of a Graduate. The Ignite Plan contains four strategic goals: Student Success, Caring Culture, Premier Workforce, and Resource Stewardship. This school year, 2015-2016, marks the first year of implementation of the Strategic Plan.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The School Board is to receive quarterly updates/reports on the Strategic Plan, focused on the work accomplished and the results received. In addition, the report will outline major Strategic Plan activities for the coming year that are designed to address areas in need of improvement. This presentation and report will provide an update on the monitoring metrics and current work that support Goal 2, Caring Culture.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The following are the three overarching strategies and the desired outcomes for Goal 2, Caring Culture:</span></span></p>
