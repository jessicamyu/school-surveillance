<p><strong><u>African American History Month - February 2019</u></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Originally established as Negro History Week in 1926 by Dr. Carter G. Woodson, a noted African-American author and scholar, this event evolved into the establishment in 1976 of February as &quot;Black History Month.&quot; The commemoration has increasingly been referred to as &quot;African-American History Month,&quot; although both names are currently in use.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This year&#39;s theme, &quot;Black Migrations&quot; emphasizes the movement of people of African descent to new destinations and subsequently to new social realities. Beginning in the 20th century, African American migration patterns included relocation from southern farms to southern cities; from the South to the Northeast, Midwest, and West; from the Caribbean to US cities; and the emigration of noted African Americans to Africa and to European cities, such as Paris and London, after the end of World War I and World War II.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Such migrations resulted in a more diverse and stratified interracial and intra-racial urban population amid a changing social milieu, the emergence of both black industrial workers and black entrepreneurs; the growing number and variety of urban churches and new religions; new music forms like ragtime, blues, and jazz; the blossoming of visual and literary arts, as in New York, Washington, D.C., Chicago, and Paris in the 1910s and 1920s.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>African-American millenials have reversed the historic trend in recent years with an uptick in black populations in Atlanta, Houston and other southern communities, bringing the North-South migration full circle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<span lang="EN"><span style="background:white">Career and Technical Education or CTE month is a public awareness campaign held every February to celebrate CTE and the achievements and accomplishments of CTE programs across the country. This year&#39;s theme, &quot;Celebrate Today, Own Tomorrow!&quot; raises awareness of the innovation and excellence that exists in our CTE programs as well as the crucial role that CTE plays in readying our students for careers and our nation for economic success. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

These careers may require varying levels of education--from high school to postsecondary certificates to two- and four-year college degrees.<br />
<br />
The subject areas most commonly associated with career and technical education are: Business and Information Technology (programming, accounting, cyber security); Trade and Industrial (skilled trades such as automotive technician, carpenter, cosmetologist, law enforcement); Health and Medical Sciences (nursing, dental, and emergency medical technicians); Family and Consumer Sciences (culinary arts, child development, education); Marketing (sales, fashion and entrepreneurship); and Technology Education (electronics, robotics and engineering).<br />
<br />
Career and technical education is offered in middle schools, high schools, two-year community and technical colleges and other postsecondary schools. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 18 of the 20 fastest growing occupations within the next decade will require career and technical education. <i>Thank you to all of our CTE teachers and staff who help students realize Portrait of a Graduate outcomes and ensure students are college and career ready!</i></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong>1. </strong>I move to amend the main motion by adding the following&nbsp;on page 163: &quot;<u>Solar PPA Pilot:</u> FCPS plans to complete the installation of solar panels on at least three schools upon the conclusion of the joint County and Schools RFP. It is recommended that the power generated by the solar arrays will provide at least 76% of the energy required to operate each school. On January 14<sup>th</sup>, 2019 the FCPS School Board selected three schools to be included in the Fairfax County 2019 Request for Proposals for a Power Purchase Agreement. Those three schools are Chantilly High School, Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, and Mason Crest Elementary School. Each facility will undergo an independent evaluation to determine their structural, electrical, environmental and economic capability to support solar panels and will be replaced by a school yet to be determined if there are issues.&quot;<strong>(Hynes)</strong></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong>2.&nbsp; </strong>I move to amend the main motion by increasing<span style="color: black;">&nbsp;the cash-flow request by an additional $25 million, thereby increasing the yearly sale on school bonds to $205 million. This will allow FCPS to continue to accelerate planning for the following 20 elementary school, two middle schools, two high schools, and one central office repurpose renovation projects,&nbsp; with an estimated reduction of 158 temporary classrooms upon completion of the projects. </span></p>

<div class="motion finalresolution">
<div>I move to amend the main motion by adding the following on page 163: "Solar PPA Pilot: FCPS plans to complete the installation of solar panels on at least three schools upon the conclusion of the joint County and Schools RFP. It is recommended that the power generated by the solar arrays will provide at least 76% of the energy required to operate each school. On January 14th, 2019 the FCPS School Board selected three schools to be included in the Fairfax County 2019 Request for Proposals for a Power Purchase Agreement. Those three schools are Chantilly High School, Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, and Mason Crest Elementary School. Each facility will undergo an independent evaluation to determine their structural, electrical, environmental and economic capability to support solar panels and will be replaced by a school yet to be determined if there are issues."</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span lang="EN" style="color: black; font-family:;" verdana="">The Chief Equity Officer recommends that the School Board award a contract to George Mason University (&quot;GMU&quot;) for the provision of graduate course work to eligible FCPS instructional personnel.&nbsp; GMU will offer courses for FCPS teachers who aspire to obtain a master&#39;s degree under the master&#39;s Cohort Tuition Sharing Program, the Title I Master&#39;s Degree Tuition Sharing Program and the Special Education contract courses program.&nbsp; Each program is referred to as the &quot;Program&quot;.&nbsp; Courses are to be taken in GMU&#39;s College of Education and Human Development.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span lang="EN" style="color: black; font-family:;" verdana="">The Master&#39;s Cohort Tuition Sharing Program was established to provide FCPS teachers on the highest steps of the BA lanes of the 2017 FCPS salary scale with an opportunity for an expedited path to a master&#39;s degree and allow them to move to a higher lane on the current scale.&nbsp; The Program pays 50 percent of the cost for teachers to further their education.&nbsp; Qualified candidates are those who are in the identified pay lanes (BA, BA+15, BA+30 - steps 15 and higher), and are accepted into a master&#39;s degree program at a regionally accredited university.&nbsp; Participants are required to commit to a minimum of three additional years with FCPS in return for the benefit.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span lang="EN" style="color: black; font-family:;" verdana="">The Tuition Reimbursement program is to encourage FCPS teachers to seek opportunities to achieve a master&#39;s degree.&nbsp; The Tuition Reimbursement program is available to teachers and other employees, but priority is given to the teachers on the bachelor&#39;s salary lanes in steps 14 and higher.&nbsp; Additional priority goes to Instructional Assistants who are in the degree programs that will lead to licensure with the State of Virginia and potentially fill a position in a critical shortage area.&nbsp; Students are invoiced for, and obligated to pay, the full tuition from a regionally accredited college or university such as GMU and them apply for reimbursement through Professional Learning and Family Engagement.&nbsp; Reimbursement is not guaranteed due to funding limitations.&nbsp; This agreement also allows employees on BA Lanes 15 and higher to receive an additional discount (10%) on top of the Virginia Education Discount (15%) offered to all educators by GMU.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Finally, GMU will provide contract courses for eligible FCPS employees that can be used as qualification for a provisional license in Special Education with the State of Virginia.&nbsp; The goal of this program is to fill urgent vacancies in special education classrooms across Fairfax County Public Schools.&nbsp; FCPS is invoiced for an obligated to pay 100 percent of the &quot;contract course&quot; tuition rate.&nbsp; The program allows up to 150 FCPS staff per year to meet the eligibility requirement for provisional licensure and fill an urgent need in special education classrooms in FCPS.&nbsp; Participants are required to commit to an FCPS Special Education positions for a three (3) year period and join a Special Education cohort (at their own expense) to obtain full licensure within three years.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Estimated contract expenditures by FCPS over the three (3) year term is a maximum of $1.675 million, or a range between $200,000 and $520,000 per academic year based upon the level of participation in the cohorts.</span></span></p>
