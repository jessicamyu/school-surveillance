<div class="itembody"><p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="background:white"><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;"><span style="color:black">It is my greatest honor to speak tonight on behalf of the School Board in recognition of Coach Darrell General, who has been named as America&rsquo;s 2018 &ldquo;Hometown Hero,&rdquo; a competitive nationwide award sponsored by FloSports live digital sports company. The award recognizes &ldquo;the finest coaches across the country who have made an impact in their community by changing high-school-age athletes&rsquo; lives for the better.&rdquo; Coach General, who was one of the five finalists, took home $25,000 for winning the award. I can safely say that here is no one more qualified for this award. If I can think of one word to describe Coach General, it is selfless. His care for others is infectious, always prioritizing the success of others before himself. I should say, of course, that he never puts himself first unless he&rsquo;s winning a marathon.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="background:white"><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;"><span style="color:black">And I should know about the difference that he has made in the lives of countless students. After all, he was my running coach for three years at Marshall. General has coached at Marshall since 2002, now for 16 years, and he has coached for 32 years overall. Don&rsquo;t let his size deceive you. This man has won two Marine Corps Marathons&mdash;in 1995 and 1997&mdash;he was the top American finisher at the Boston Marathon in 1990, and he has run in about 35 marathons across the country and overseas. And he still runs Marathons to this day.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="background:white"><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;"><span style="color:black">When he was 21, he was the youngest person to qualify for the 1988 Olympic trials, and since then he has qualified for five Olympic trials, including when he was serving as my coach in 2004. He has twice been ranked among the top ten runners in the United States. In 1989, he ran his personal best marathon-time of 2 hours, 14 minutes, and 42 seconds.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="background:white"><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;"><span style="color:black">But again, Darrell&rsquo;s life has been first and foremost about helping others. He believes that coaching allows him to give back to the sport he picked up as a kid growing up in Southeast D.C. He has said, &ldquo;I know I was fast enough and strong enough to challenge for an Olympic sport but helping out and coaching was more important to me than trying to be an Olympian.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="background:white"><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;"><span style="color:black">In 2017, I had the honor of presenting a different recognition to Darrell on behalf of the School Board after he had been named All-Met Girls&rsquo; Cross-Country Coach of the Year. In Fall 2016, he led his star runner Heather Holt to the individual state cross country championship and the Marshall girls team to the school&rsquo;s first state championship <u>in any sport</u> in 40 years, going all the way back to girls&rsquo; basketball in 1976. That same year, he also led the boys to a regional title. The Marshall cross-country team has gotten progressively bigger and better under his leadership.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="background:white"><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;"><span style="color:black">When he was my coach, my peers and I had no idea what kind of crazy life he was leading because he would never talk about it. To support his family, he was working three jobs <u>in addition to</u> coaching Marshall students and keeping up his personal training. His daily schedule went like this: he worked at Whole Foods from 1 a.m. to 8 a.m., helped out with a D.C. running group from 8 to 9:30am, worked at Metro Run &amp; Walk from 10 to 3pm, then came to coach at Marshall. After going on his own run, he would sleep maybe 3-4 hours each night. To this day, he still crosses the Potomac, driving a long distance to support our schools and our kids.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="background:white"><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;"><span style="color:black">But Darrell&rsquo;s service to Fairfax County Public Schools is not limited to coaching. This past fall, a custodial position opened at Marshall High School. Principal Jeff Litz and DSA Joe Swarm asked Darrell if he would be interested in the position. And of course, Darrell answered yes. I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that he also holds the unofficial designation as the fastest custodian in FCPS.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="background:white"><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;"><span style="color:black">And when the opportunity to recognize Darrell as a hometown hero arose this past year, his students leapt into action&mdash;creating promotional campaigns including Twitter and Instagram accounts to secure him the online vote totals to win.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="background:white"><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;"><span style="color:black">He has said that he will use his $25,000 prize to help pay off his bills, and he may eventually throw a party for the Marshall track teams to celebrate. He has assured me that School Board members will also be invited to the party.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="background:white"><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;"><span style="color:black">Congratulations, Coach General, for all you have done for Marshall and Fairfax County Public Schools over the years. Sometimes the little guys do, in fact, win.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="background:white"><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;"><span style="color:black">Now, before we come together for a photo, I want to recognize the staff of Marshall High School and Darrell&rsquo;s family members who are here with us. From Marshall we have Principal Jeff Litz, Director of Student Activities Joe Swarm, and Director of Student Services Cindy Blakeley.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
