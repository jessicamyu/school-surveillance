<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Key Points:</strong></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">All of the FY 2017 accounts have been closed subject to the annual audit. A summary of the revenue and expenditure variances is provided for each of the nine funds. All comparisons are against the FY&nbsp;2017 Third Quarter Budget Review.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">In the School Operating Fund, after accounting for the revenue variance and the FY 2018 budgeted beginning balance, the flexibility reserve, fuel contingency, textbook reserve, and other commitments, the FY 2017 funds available total $33.9 million.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Revenue variances begin on page 1 of the agenda attachment, and FY 2017 actual total funds available are $1.3 million less, or 99.95 percent, of the FY 2017 Third Quarter Budget Review projection. State Aid for FY 2017 totals $417.7 million, which is $4.3 million more than budgeted, and sales tax receipts total $191.1 million, $1.3 million less than budgeted. Federal revenue totaled $45.8 million, which is $6.1 million lower than budgeted primarily as a net result of unspent multiyear grant awards that will be carried forward and reappropriated in FY 2018 offset by a reimbursement of $1.3 million from FEMA. Other revenue receipts, including tuition, fees, other service charges, and miscellaneous revenue, are $1.8 million more than the third quarter estimate.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Expenditure variances begin on page 2 of the agenda attachment, and FY 2017 actual expenditures are $35.2 million less than projected after funding the FY 2018 beginning balance, School Flexibility Reserve, fuel contingency, and accounting for other commitments and carryover, excluding grants. The expenditure variance of $35.2 million totals 1.3 percent of the FY 2017 Third Quarter Budget and includes $14.9 million from salaries, $10.1 million from employee benefits, and $2.4 million from other accounts, primarily utilities. In addition, $7.8 million in multiyear unspent federal grant funds is carried forward and reappropriated for FY&nbsp;2018.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">As a result of the revenue and expenditure variances, the total funding available from FY 2017 totals $33.9 million.&nbsp; This agenda item includes recommendations for FY 2018 expenditure adjustments. Items identified as part of the FY 2018 Approved Budget include placeholder funding of $3.3 million for potential bonus options for employees who did not receive a salary increase in FY 2018 as well as setting aside an additional $1.7 million for the staffing reserve to mitigate the impact of the class size increase and address large class sizes. Prior committed priorities and requirements include $3.6 million to continue FCPS&rsquo; annual commitment to allocate funding from year-end for major maintenance; $0.2 million for the fourth and final year of the development of world language curriculum and to identify opportunities to develop global partnerships; and $0.6 million to address a shortfall in Adult and Community Education. Funding to support key strategic plan investments includes $0.5 million for employee recruitment and retention initiatives.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">All of the remaining funding available, $24.1 million, is recommended to be set aside for a FY 2019 budgeted beginning balance.&nbsp;This results in an initial shortfall of $9.4 million as compared to the beginning balance funding included in the FY 2018 Approved Budget. Looking ahead to FY 2018, additional expenditure requirements may be necessary as part of compliance with the MS4 stormwater permit and federal stormwater mandates. FCPS and the county established a partnership on the joint use of covered salt storage. The County and FCPS are working together to plan for a salt storage facility that will be constructed at the Woodson Complex. Also during FY 2018, FCPS will be piloting lower cost options for replacing bus radios. Any expenditure increases from the stormwater and savings from the radios will be presented to the School Board at an FY 2018 quarterly budget review.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Changes to other School Board funds are detailed in the attachment.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Recommendation:</strong></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">That the School Board approve the revenue and expenditure adjustments as detailed in the agenda item.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong><span style="color: black;">Key Points</span></strong><span style="color: black;">:</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="color: black;">In accordance with its policy, the School Board decides on an annual basis whether or not to cooperate with the Virginia State Department of Education to operate Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJHSST) as a regional school.&nbsp; The recommendation to continue to operate TJHSST as a regional school is based on the following advantages:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Additional state funding for the regional school.&nbsp; <u>The estimate for FY 2018 is $3,283,460.&nbsp; The tuition for out-of-county students is estimated at $5,163,895.</u></span></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Cooperation with participating school divisions to provide their qualified students the opportunity to attend the specialized high school.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Status the Governor&rsquo;s School designation provides in attracting corporate sponsors throughout the Northern Virginia area.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Greater visibility throughout the region, the Commonwealth, and the nation under the umbrella of the state initiative.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong><span style="color: black;">Options</span></strong><span style="color: black;">:</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="color: black;">The disadvantages of not continuing as a regional school are loss of state funding and possible disruption of relationships with the Virginia Department of Education and the participating school divisions.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong><span style="color: black;">Recommendation</span></strong><span style="color: black;">:</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="color: black;">That the School Board accept the Virginia Department of Education designation of Fairfax County Public Schools as the Governor&rsquo;s Regional School for Science and Technology in Northern Virginia for <u>2017-2018</u>.</span></span></span></p>
