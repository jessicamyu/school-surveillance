<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Established in 1974, National Volunteer Week has grown exponentially in scope each year since, drawing the support and endorsement of all subsequent U.S. presidents, governors, mayors and other respected elected officials.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">National Volunteer Week is about inspiring, recognizing, and encouraging people to seek out imaginative ways to engage in their communities. It&rsquo;s about demonstrating to the nation that by working together, in unison, we have the fortitude to meet our challenges and accomplish our goals. National Volunteer Week is about taking action, encouraging individuals and their respective communities to be at the center of social change&mdash;discovering and actively demonstrating their collective power to foster positive transformation.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">During the 2015-2016 school year, 194 schools, centers, and alternative high schools reported that 64,617 volunteers donated 1,556,265 hours of volunteer service to FCPS schools.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p><u><strong><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">National Sleep Awareness Week - April 23-29, 2017</span></span></strong></u></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="color: black;">The National Sleep Foundation is celebrating its annual Sleep Awareness Week April 23 - 29, to raise awareness of the health benefits of sleep and its importance to safety and productivity. This year&#39;s theme &quot;Sleep Better, Feel Better&quot; encourages people to consider how sleep effects their daily lives, and reinforce the many benefits associated with making healthy sleep habits a priority.&nbsp; The National Sleep Foundation believes the value of a good night&#39;s sleep which carries in to one&#39;s day to improve not just health, but mood, productivity, well-being and overall quality of life. &nbsp; Most of us know that getting a good night&rsquo;s sleep is important, but too few of us actually make those eight or so hours a priority. So many of us have forgotten what &ldquo;being really, truly rested&rdquo; feels like. To further complicate matters, stimulants like coffee and energy drinks, alarm clocks, and external lights, including those from electronic devices, interfere with our natural sleep/wake cycle. </span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="color: black;">Sleep needs vary across ages and are especially impacted by lifestyle and health. To determine how much sleep you need, it&#39;s important to examine what lifestyle factors are affecting the quality and quantity of your sleep such as work schedules and stress. </span>For more information on healthy sleep, visit the National Sleep Foundation&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://sleep.org/" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(0, 83, 160);">Sleep.org</span></a>.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Each year our nation designates April as the <strong><em>Month of the Military Child</em></strong> to recognize and thank children from military families for the sacrifices they make living the military lifestyle.&nbsp; The recognition is part of the legacy of former Defense Secretary Casper Weinberger who established the commemoration in 1986.&nbsp;&nbsp; During the month, one day is selected as the day to &ldquo;Purple Up! For Military Kids&rdquo; and all are encouraged to wear purple in recognition of the strength and sacrifices of military connected youth (MCY).&nbsp; Why purple?&nbsp; Purple is the color that symbolizes all branches of the military, as it is the combination of Army green, Coast Guard blue, Air Force blue, Marine red, and Navy blue.&nbsp; This year PURPLE UP day will be celebrated on April 21<sup>st</sup>.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Military Connected Youth face unique circumstances living the military lifestyle. &nbsp;By understanding the lifestyle of military connected youth we can better meet their needs as they transition with their family members who serve our nation. Currently over 11,000 military connected youth call FCPS home.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Celebrating the Month of the Military Child provides a powerful opportunity to raise awareness and build support to help these children meet the unique challenges they face! It is an opportunity to recognize and thank military children and youth for their heroism, character, courage, sacrifices and continued resilience.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">In July 2015, the School Board approved <strong>Ignite, </strong>the strategic plan for Fairfax County Public Schools, which represents the cooperative work of the School Board and Leadership Team, with significant community input, to create a long term plan for continuous improvement. At the core of this plan is the FCPS <em>Portrait of a Graduate</em>. The Ignite Plan contains four strategic goals: Student Success, Caring Culture, Premier Workforce, and Resource Stewardship. School year 2016-2017, marks our second year of implementation of the Strategic Plan.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The School Board is to receive quarterly updates/reports on the Strategic Plan, focused on the work accomplished and the results received. &nbsp;In addition, the report will outline major Strategic Plan activities for the coming year that are designed to address areas in need of improvement.

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Related To:&nbsp; </strong>Strategic Plan</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">In July 2015, the School Board approved <strong>Ignite, </strong>the strategic plan for Fairfax County Public Schools, which represents the cooperative work of the School Board and Leadership Team, with significant community input, to create a long term plan for continuous improvement. At the core of this plan is the FCPS <em>Portrait of a Graduate</em>. The Ignite Plan contains four strategic goals: Student Success, Caring Culture, Premier Workforce, and Resource Stewardship. School year 2016-2017, marks our second year of implementation of the Strategic Plan.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The School Board is to receive quarterly updates/reports on the Strategic Plan, focused on the work accomplished and the results received. &nbsp;In addition, the report will outline major Strategic Plan activities for the coming year that are designed to address areas in need of improvement. This presentation and report will provide an update on the monitoring metrics and current work that support Goal 2, Caring Culture.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The following are the three overarching strategies and the desired outcomes for Goal 2, Caring Culture:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Key Points: </strong></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">FCPS seeks to establish a list of qualified engineers to provide construction testing and inspection services for capital construction projects.&nbsp; Generally, these engineering services are typically valued at less than $100,000 for each project.&nbsp; However, the aggregate dollar amount of services performed under the contract can be more than $250,000 annually.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">On March 22, 2017, proposals were received for RFP #17-016, Construction Testing and Inspection Services for capital construction projects.&nbsp; The Selection Advisory Committee (SAC) is evaluating eleven (11) proposals received in accordance with the criteria set forth in School Board Policy 8220.4.&nbsp; The SAC will then recommend the top ranked firms for contract negotiation consideration prior to the April 27, 2017 School Board Meeting.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Recommendation:</strong></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">That the School Board authorize staff to negotiate professional service contracts with selected firms for construction testing and inspection services, and authorize the Division Superintendent, or the Assistant Superintendent of Facilities and Transportation Services, to execute, deliver, and administer contracts on behalf of the School Board.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>School Board Action Required:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Information&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Related To:&nbsp; </strong>Legal Requirement </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Key Points: </strong></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The Department of Special Services, as required by Public Law 108-446, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004, has completed the Local Special Education Annual Plan and Report for the 2017-2018 school year, as required by VDOE <a href="http://www.doe.virginia.gov/administrators/superintendents_memos/2016/311-16.shtml">Superintendent's memo #311-16</a><strong>, </strong>dated December 16<strong>, </strong>2016.&nbsp; This report will be used by the Virginia Department of Education in preparing the state plan for special education.&nbsp; As required by VDOE, this report has been prepared and will be submitted entirely online in a VDOE-prescribed abbreviated format on a date, no later than May 12, 2017.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The 2017-2018 Section 611, Part B application estimates revenue to Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) of $34,595,155.&nbsp; This amount is equal to the final 2016–2017 award as stated in <a href="http://www.doe.virginia.gov/administrators/superintendents_memos/2016/262-16.shtml">Superintendent's memo #262-16</a>, dated October 14, 2016.&nbsp; Estimated expenditures include cost associated with the voluntary 15% set-aside for Coordinated Early Intervening Services (CEIS), and a mandatory private school set-aside, which ensures that FCPS spends a proportionate share of funds on special education services for parentally placed private school children with disabilities. The IDEA Section 611, Part B, award will fund a total of 415.7 FTE positions.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The 2017-2018 Section 619, Part B Preschool application estimates revenue to FCPS of $774,977.&nbsp; This amount is equal to the final 2016-2017 award as stated in <a href="http://www.doe.virginia.gov/administrators/superintendents_memos/2016/182-16.shtml">Superintendent's memo #182-16</a>, dated July 22, 2016.&nbsp; These funds support Child Find activities as well as parenting and transition services for school-age students.&nbsp; Estimated expenditures include costs associated with state restricted indirect costs of 1.2%.&nbsp; IDEA Section 619 (Preschool) funds 6.0 FTE positions.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The revenue amounts above reflect no change from the 2016-2017 awards.&nbsp; The 2017-2018 application reflects estimated costs for the current programs funded in the 2016-2017 application.&nbsp; Small adjustments in both sections 611 and 619 have been made for incumbent salaries, employee benefit costs, materials/supplies and the state restricted indirect cost rate.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The 2017-2018 Annual Plan was presented to the Fairfax County Advisory Committee for Students with Disabilities (ACSD) at the March 8, 2017 meeting.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Recommendation:</strong></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">It is recommended that the School Board approve the 2017-2018 Annual Special Education plan, Section 611, Part B grant funding application and Section 619, Part B Preschool grant funding application as detailed in the agenda item.</span></span></p>
