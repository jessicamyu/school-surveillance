<p>
	<span style="font-family:verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:9.0pt;">Teachers are real life superheroes.&nbsp; They educate, innovate, encourage, and support, touching the lives of millions of children.&nbsp; Every day, over 15,000 teachers in Fairfax County Public Schools demonstrate their personal and professional dedication to providing an excellent education for the children in our community. Our teachers are committed to ensuring that all children develop their full potential for academic achievement. Teachers are influential in fostering in their students both healthful self-concepts and a sense of civic responsibility. Fairfax County Public Schools values the skills, creativity, and professionalism that characterize our teachers. </span></span></p>

<p>
	<span style="font-family:verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:9.0pt;">Americans of Asian and Pacific ancestry have made significant contributions to the history and development of the United States in many fields of endeavor such as science, commerce, the arts, and the humanities. The Fairfax County School Board recognizes that an understanding of these contributions should be an integral part of the year-round education of all students.<br />
	<br />
	Since 1992, the President of the United States has proclaimed May to be Asian- and Pacific-American Heritage Month and has chosen this month to pay tribute to the generations of Asian and Pacific Islanders who have enriched American&rsquo;s history and are instrumental in its future success.</span></span></p>

	<strong><span style="font-family:verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:9.0pt;">School Nurse Day - May 11</span>, 2016</span></strong><br />
	<br />
	<span style="font-family:verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:9.0pt;">School Nurse Day was established in 1972 to foster a better understanding of the role of school nurses in the educational setting.&nbsp; This annual event recognizes the contributions that school nurses make every day to improve the health and success of our nation&rsquo;s children.&nbsp; This year&rsquo;s theme, &ldquo;School Nurses:&nbsp; Better Health. Better Learning</span>,&rdquo; reflects the significant roles that school nurses have in health care in their school communities, as well as in modeling health and resiliency.<br />
	<br />
	School nursing is a specialized practice of professional nursing that advances the health and well-being of students and is an integral part of a quality school health program. School nurses promote health, safety, prevention, and wellness; intervene with actual and potential health problems; and provide case management services.&nbsp; They are an invaluable bridge connecting health care providers, public health, and families.<br />
	<br />
	The school system works closely with the Fairfax County Health Department to provide quality services to the children of Fairfax County Public Schools and recognized May 11 as School Nurse Day in Fairfax County.</span></p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,sans-serif;">Since 1927, the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) has celebrated Better Hearing and Speech Month every year in May. The theme this year is &ldquo;Early Intervention Counts,&rdquo; a campaign to make people aware of the warning signs of speech, language, and hearing problems and the positive effect that early intervention can have to reverse and even prevent them. This annual event provides opportunities to promote services that can improve the quality of life for those who experience problems with speaking and listening. An estimated 42 million people have communication disorders and they impact one in ten families.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,sans-serif;">Currently, Fairfax County Public Schools provides speech and language services to more than 10,000 students.&nbsp; Audiologists and special education teachers also serve more than 500 deaf and hard of hearing students in class-based programs, via base school itinerant services, and in early childhood programs.&nbsp; FCPS annually observes and celebrates Better Hearing and Speech Month and encourages all citizens in our school community to recognize the efforts, dedication, and skills of the speech-language clinicians, audiologists, and teachers of students who are deaf and hard of hearing. </span></span></p>

School nutrition employees must balance many roles and follow numerous federal, state and local regulations to ensure safe and healthy meals are available in schools. They are trained sanitation and food safety experts and must manage financially self-sufficient programs. School nutrition professionals also provide nutrition education to students, as well as healthy catering services to their communities.

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The Federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has declared May 5 to be National Children&rsquo;s Mental Health Awareness Day.</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The well-being of children has a profound, immediate and lasting impact on our community.&nbsp; Nationally over one in five children and youth have a mental health issue and only half of children and youth with behavioral health issues receive treatment.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Current national statistics show that approximately 36,000 Fairfax County children and youth have a diagnosable mental health condition; including 3,960 with significant impairment and 1,800 with extreme impairment.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there are multiple barriers preventing families from accessing timely and appropriate behavioral health services, including high deductible/high co-pay insurance plans, and lack of providers that accept Medicaid and insurance.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">In their FY 2015 budget, the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors approved an expansion of behavioral health services for youth and families in order to address&nbsp; Fairfax youth behavioral health needs in the community.&nbsp; Through this expansion, Fairfax County Public Schools , Fairfax&nbsp; County Human Services, non-profit agencies, family and consumer organizations are together implementing a multi-year Children&rsquo;s Behavioral Health System of Care Blueprint to address barriers to accessing services through coordinating prevention, early intervention, and intensive treatment services across the human services system, schools and private providers.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p>
	<strong><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Key Points:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">In July 2015, the School Board approved Ignite, the strategic plan for Fairfax County Public Schools, which represents the cooperative work of the School Board and Leadership Team, with significant community input, to create a long term plan for continuous improvement. At the core of this plan is the FCPS Portrait of a Graduate. The Ignite Plan contains four strategic goals: Student Success, Caring Culture, Premier Workforce, and Resource Stewardship. This school year, 2015-2016, marks the first year of implementation of the Strategic Plan.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The School Board is to receive quarterly updates/reports on the Strategic Plan, focused on the work accomplished and the results received. In addition, the report will outline major Strategic Plan activities for the coming year that are designed to address areas in need of improvement. This presentation and report will provide an update on the monitoring metrics and current work that support Goal 2, Caring Culture.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

			<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Subject</strong>: School Board Policies for Fraud, Waste and Abuse and, Protection Against Retaliation</span></span></p>

			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Key Points</strong>:&nbsp; The School Board does not tolerate unethical behavior and protects those who report allegations of suspected activities of wrong doing.&nbsp; FCPS has existing regulations that direct the Superintendent&rsquo;s office as well as the Office of Auditor General to execute and enforce actions that protect the Division against unethical behavior.&nbsp; These two proposed school board policies memorialize the School Board&rsquo;s current positions on fraud and anti-retaliation.&nbsp; Each attached, proposed school board policy references the corresponding regulations.</span></span></p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The policy on Fraud, Waste and Abuse defines <em>waste</em> and <em>abuse</em>, which correspond to the fraud, waste and abuse hotline. These definitions will be reflected in the revisions to the corresponding regulations for reporting and investigating fraud, waste and abuse by the offices of Auditor General, Division Counsel, Human Resources, Risk Management and other &nbsp;FCPS offices.&nbsp; The policy on Protection against Retaliation akin to a &ldquo;whistleblower&rdquo; policy, and coordinates the purpose and responsibility of the offices of Division Counsel and Human Resources.</span></span></p>

		&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Fairfax County Water Authority (&quot;FCWA&quot;) has asked that the School Board grant a water main easement and associated temporary construction easements at Groveton Elementary School (the &quot;Property&quot;) in connection with its South Kings Highway Transmission Main project (the &quot;Project&quot;).&nbsp; </span></span></p>
	<p style="margin-left:27.35pt;">
		&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The Office of Design and Construction has reviewed the proposal and has determined that (i) the requested easements will have no negative impact on the operation of the school site and (ii) FCWA&#39;s proposed improvements will provide direct benefit to Groveton Elementary School in increased water pressure, as well as additional asphalt paving in the school&rsquo;s bus lane, all of which will constitute appropriate compensation for the easements. </span></span></p>
	<p style="margin-left:27.35pt;">
		&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The requested easements extend through the Property from the Harrison Lane right-of-way on the eastern frontage of the Property, westward to the southern terminus of Amlong Avenue, as shown on the easement plat.&nbsp; Upon completion of the Project, FCWA will abandon and quitclaim to the School Board the existing water line easements at Groveton Elementary School.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
