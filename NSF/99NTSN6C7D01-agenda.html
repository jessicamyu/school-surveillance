Wellness Award (Giving Others Lifelong Desire for Exercise and Nutrition) recognizes schools that focus on wellness in their school and school community.&nbsp; The award was developed by the FCPS Wellness Task Force in 2010 to promote the FCPS Wellness Policy.&nbsp; The policy addresses School Board Student Achievement Goals 2.8: &ldquo;Students will make healthy and safe life choices,&rdquo; and Goal 3.2: &ldquo;Students will be respectful and contributing participants in their school, community, country, and world.&rdquo; &nbsp;The policy guidelines include nutrition education, food and beverages served during the school day, and physical activity and physical education.</span></span></p>

	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Fairfax County School Board</strong></span></span></p>
<p align="center">
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>RESOLUTION ON STATE ASSESSMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY REFORM</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>WHEREAS</em></strong>, in recent years the proliferation of high stakes standardized testing and the increasing role played by those test scores in key educational policy decisions, while well intentioned, has resulted in a narrowing of the instructional mission of schools, and caused a focus on compliance rather than on fostering a love of learning and instilling a culture of constant instructional improvement; and</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>WHEREAS</em></strong>, Virginia&rsquo;s students must currently take thirty-four criterion-referenced Standards of Learning (SOL) assessments between grades three and eleven, greatly increasing the amount of time spent by students and teachers on taking and managing assessments rather than on learning and teaching, with little evidence that students are better prepared to succeed in college and in their chosen careers by having taken such a volume of tests; little research to verify the usefulness and accuracy of Virginia&rsquo;s method of relying upon SOL test results to measure growth in student achievement; and little research to verify that Virginia&rsquo;s method of measuring student growth provides a valid and reliable indicator of teacher, principal and superintendent performance; and</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>WHEREAS</em></strong>, the current Standards of Learning and their associated assessments are still largely focused on information recall and do not adequately address the acquisition and mastery of the skills required for students to be successful in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century such as innovation, literacy, collaboration, critical analysis, creative thinking, problem solving, and communication; and</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>WHEREAS</em></strong>, what occurs in classrooms every day should be student-centered and result in learning at a deep and meaningful level with opportunities for students to cultivate their unique individual talents, provide options for students that are designed to respect how they learn best, and embrace the concept that students can be both consumers and creators of knowledge; &nbsp;as opposed to the superficial level of learning that results from the current over-emphasis on that which can be easily measured by standardized tests; and</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>WHEREAS</em></strong>, we recognize the need for and support accountability and transparency in public schools, but believe that such accountability should be designed to appropriately assess the achievement of all students, provide educationally-valuable information, recognize the roles of students, parents, teachers and schools in those results, and which can be leveraged to improve educational policy and practice; </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED</em></strong> that the Fairfax County School Board calls on the Virginia General Assembly and Virginia Board of Education to reexamine Virginia&rsquo;s public school assessments and the system of accountability for which they form the basis to ensure that the state&rsquo;s assessment system provides educationally-valuable information, is reliable, valid, fair, and nonintrusive on the learning process and allows for the measurement of the acquisition and mastery of &ldquo;21<sup>st</sup> Century Skills;&rdquo; and</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>ALSO, BE IT RESOLVED</em></strong> that such a reexamination to improve the current accountability and assessment system should potentially include a consideration of the use of statistically valid sampling techniques as utilized by assessments such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), opportunities to allow students to forgo standardized assessments in certain years based on previous high achievement levels, and expanded use of internationally benchmarked assessments as a substitute for SOL assessments.</span></span></p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>School Board Action Required:&nbsp; </strong>Information</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Related To:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; School Board Policy 5011.2 Authority to Contract</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Key Points:</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The Department of Facilities and Transportation Services recommends implementing a division-wide Energy Conservation Program that will save money as well as energy and also provide an acculturative environmental education program for the benefit of all FCPS staff and students. </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The Department&rsquo;s review and investigation has resulted in the identification of Cenergistic, Incorporated, an energy conservation company which specializes in developing and implementing energy management, conservation and educational programs in public school facilities. </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Cenergistic has a national client base and a track record of successful energy management related cost savings for a number of public school systems, including Loudoun, Roanoke, Prince William, and Williamsburg&ndash;James City Counties in Virginia. </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Cenergistic&rsquo;s methodology is to use a team of experienced energy experts that work with school division personnel to perform onsite assessments of each school facility. Based on the data collected, the Cenergistic team will build and recommend a detailed action plan specifically for FCPS which will identify energy savings opportunities, optimize building profiles, and provide critical strategies to implement the program successfully. </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The Cenergistic program would be self-funded through the utility cost savings achieved, as Cenergistic&rsquo;s customary fee is a negotiated percentage of the utility savings realized.&nbsp; The Energy Conservation Program is expected to include no capital investment; savings are contractually warranted to exceed all investments in the program. Following a six month start-up phase, the projected first-year net savings are estimated to be $5,061,840. The ten-year net savings, however, is projected to be $72,137,941.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The relationship between FCPS and Cenergistic would be memorialized in a written agreement with a five and a half-year term. The Virginia Public Procurement Act authorizes FCPS, in this instance, to conduct a cooperative procurement by utilizing an existing competitively procured contract that was previously awarded by Prince William County Schools, together with such agreed-upon modifications as are appropriate to serve the interests of FCPS. <u>VA Code Ann</u>. &sect; 2.2-4304.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Recommendation:</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">That the School Board authorize the Division Superintendent or the Assistant Superintendent of Facilities and Transportation Services, in consultation with Division Counsel, to negotiate, execute and administer on behalf of the School Board an Energy Conservation Program contract with Cenergistic, Incorporated.</span></span></p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>School Board Action Required:</strong>&nbsp; Information</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Key Points:</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The Department of Facilities &amp; Transportation Services recommends the acquisition of a 5-story office building and related property on 3.4 acres, located at 6245 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church, in the Seven Corners area of the County (the &ldquo;Property&rdquo;).</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Once acquired, the former office building would be retrofitted and converted to a vertical design school in order to provide relief for the severely over-crowded Bailey&rsquo;s Elementary School for the Arts &amp; Sciences, which is currently at 130% capacity. Significant increases in elementary student enrollment in this area are projected to continue for the foreseeable future.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The Office of Design &amp; Construction (through its own employees as well as with independent architects, engineers, and specialized commissioning agents) conducted on-site inspections of the Property on October 10 and 11, 2013. Results of this site inspection and subsequent testing indicate that while some remedial work would be required, conversion of the office building to an elementary school building is feasible. The office building has been vacant since September of 2012.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Consistent with the School Board&rsquo;s prior direction, Facilities officials and Division Counsel have made a number of attempts since July 15, 2013, to reach an agreed-upon purchase of the Property. To date, those efforts have been unsuccessful. The School Board is authorized by &sect;22.1-127 of the Code of Virginia to exercise its right of eminent domain in order to acquire the Property, which is necessary for public school purposes.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Recommendation:</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">That, following a public hearing on December 5, 2013, the School Board adopt a resolution, approving the proposed public use of the Property as an elementary school and directing the Division Superintendent or Assistant Superintendent of Facilities and Transportation Services, in consultation with legal counsel for the school division, to acquire the Property for this public purpose by condemnation or other means. </span></span></p>
