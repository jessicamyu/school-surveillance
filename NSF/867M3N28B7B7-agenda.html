This year, only administrative changes were made to the document; no actions on the part of the 2005 General Assembly affected the </font><i><font face="Arial">Purchasing Resolution</font></i><font face="Arial">.  The most significant changes include:</font></ul><br><img src="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/867M5G28BBAE/Body/0.760?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="12" height="12"><font face="Arial">	Identification of consultant services as a stand-alone definition and process, separate from professional services. </font><br><ul><ul><ul><ul><i><font face="Arial">Professional services and consultant services are now defined as separate service categories.  Consultant services are defined as, &#8220;any type of services required by the County, but not furnished by its own employees, which is so unique that it should be obtained by negotiation on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualification.&#8221;  In contrast, professional services are a distinct service category under the Virginia Code, requiring professional licensure and a greater focus on qualifications during the selection process.  Establishing a separate definition and process for consultant services will not change the existing contract review and approval requirements.</font></i></ul></ul></ul></ul><br><img src="/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/legacy-content/867M5G28BBAE/Body/0.D8C?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif" width="12" height="12"><font face="Arial">	Modification of the process for negotiating a contract with a consultant, establishing consistency with the Virginia Public Procurement Act §2.2-4301 3b.  </font><br><ul><ul><ul><ul><i><font face="Arial">Modification of the process for procurement of consultant services changes the dynamic in which the County negotiates with vendors.  Until enactment of the 2005 Purchasing Resolution, the County conducted negotiations serially; that is, negotiations were conducted with the top rated offeror and a contract awarded if one could be agreed upon.  If the County was unable to negotiate successfully with the top rated offeror, then negotiations were formally terminated and negotiations commenced with the second rated offeror and a contract awarded if one could be agreed upon, and so forth.  The new process allows concurrent negotiations providing the County with the ability to negotiate with multiple offerors.  Conducting negotiations with multiple offerors positions the County to compare and contrast competing offers simultaneously, tailoring the final agreement to best meet the needs of the County. </font></i></ul></ul></ul></ul><br><font face="Arial">Attachment provided to School Board Members only in hard copy. </font><br><br></div>
