Capital improvement programming provides the foundation for cost-effective investment and construction project management of facility needs identified throughout the planning period.  Voter authorization to issue bonds is needed in November 2009 to provide construction funds for a new middle school, construction of several additions to existing schools, renovation of one high school, planning funds for the renovation of a middle school, and funding for relocation for modular building additions to meet critical capacity needs.</font><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><b><font face="Arial"> </font></b></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><font face="Arial"> </font><b><font face="Arial">KEY POINTS:            </font></b><br><br><font face="Arial">		In the past two years, school membership has grown by approximately 5,200 students and continued growth is projected.  By 2013 approximately 50 schools will be over capacity by more than 10 percent and 31 schools will exceed capacity by more than 20 percent. The schools identified for capacity enhancements were selected based on the severity of the capacity deficit ratio which, for the schools selected, range from 1.24 to 1.45, and are limited to those schools where the capacity deficit can not be solved by other solutions such as program moves, boundary changes,  planned renovations, or construction of new schools.  For example, while Poe Middle School is severely overcrowded, we have proposed a boundary study that should provide relief to that school.   </font><ul><ul><font face="Arial">Staff is confident that the schools selected will continue to need  additional capacity based on the following factors: sustained high enrollment and/or growth experienced in the past several years; the continued need for temporary classrooms; the schools are located in high growth areas as defined by the County Comprehensive Plan; development in the pipeline (planned, approved and/or under construction); strong growth at the kindergarten and primary grades; and demographic characteristics.  Based on an analysis of these factors, when reviewed together with the severity of the existing and projected capacity deficits, staff strongly believes that the high enrollments at these schools will continue and that permanent building capacity enhancements as identified in the attachment will be required for the long term needs of these schools. </font><br><font face="Arial"> </font><br><font face="Arial">The proposed bond includes construction funding for capacity enhancements at eight elementary schools and one middle school to meet existing and growing enrollments.  Funds are also included to support essential infrastructure, such as roof and HVAC replacements, athletic infrastructure, and upgrades to facilities to meet Americans with Disabilities (ADA) requirements. </font><ul><ul><ul><ul><b><font face="Arial"> </font></b></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><b><font face="Arial">RECOMMENDATION:       </font></b><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><b><font face="Arial"> </font></b></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><font face="Arial">That the School Board adopt the resolution requesting the Board of Supervisors to approve and take appropriate action to place on the ballot for the November 3, 2009, general election a School Bond Referendum in the amount of $232,580,000.</font><br></ul></ul><b><font face="Arial">BOARD MEMBER AMENDMENT:</font></b><br><br><b><font face="Arial">		</font></b><font face="Arial">Amend the main motion by deleting the $50 million for construction of a new south county middle school, and instead directing those funds to the following projects:</font><p><font face="Arial">		1. $10 million to construct an addition to South County Secondary School, to accommodate current and projected student enrollment.</font><p><font face="Arial">		2. $40 million to be applied toward funding the renovation of Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology.

These deferred compensation plans are funded completely with employee money &#8211; no employer contribution is involved.  </font><br><br><font face="Arial">	The contracts for the current 403(b) plan expire on June 30, 2009.  On September 8, 2008, Fairfax County Public School&#8217;s Office of Procurement Services issued a Request for Proposal RFP09-995675-73, soliciting offers from qualified firms to provided 403(b) investment services.  The 403(b) Selection Advisory Committee (SAC) has completed an extensive RFP process to arrive at award recommendations for new 403(b) contracts.  Given the complexity of the transition to new providers and extensive counseling needed on new fund choices, staff is working with the current 403(b) vendors to obtain contract extensions until December 31, 2009.  It is recommended that the contract period for the new contracts awarded as a result of this RFP begin on September 1, 2009.  </font><br><br><b><font face="Arial">KEY POINTS:</font></b><br><br><font face="Arial">	Previously, contracts executed under 403(b) plans were considered individual investment arrangements with no employer involvement other than the taking a payroll deduction.  Over the last few years there has been increased scrutiny of these plans, which prompted the federal government to enact regulatory changes that now require the employer to provide increased oversight and compliance monitoring for 403(b) plans.  </font><br><br><font face="Arial">	In concert with these regulatory changes, most employers are substantially reducing the number of vendors which are available under the plan.  Vendor reduction allows the employer to appropriately monitor compliance with plan limits and contractual terms, but more importantly, pools the employees&#8217; investment dollars which can then be leveraged to secure lower investment management fees. The contract award recommendations made as a result of this RFP accomplish the above objectives for FCPS.  Currently, the FCPS 403(b) plan consists of six active and two grandfathered vendors, which in total constitute thousands of individual contracts that employees have executed with plan providers.  </font><br><br><br><font face="Arial">	The Request for Proposal required that proposals be submitted based on offering &#8216;best in class&#8217; fund selections and a variety of investment structures in order to meet the needs of FCPS employees.  The Request for Proposal was sent to current 403(b) providers as well as those who are registered in the eVA (Virginia e-Procurement Solution).  The SAC received proposals from eleven vendors/offerors, ten of whom were considered responsive.  The responsive vendors/offerors were: Great West Retirement Services, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company of America (VALIC), ING Life Insurance and Annuity Company, Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association - College Retirement Equities Fund (TIAA-CREF), Lincoln Financial Group, AXA, Ameriprise, Horace Mann, and Lincoln Investment Planning.  All proposals were evaluated based on the following defined criteria:</font><br><ul><ul><ul><ul type="disc"><li><font face="Arial">	Company Overview</font><li><font face="Arial">	Organizational Structure</font><li><font face="Arial">	Account Management &amp; Member Services</font><li><font face="Arial">	Investments, Plan Procedures and Recordkeeping</font><li><font face="Arial">	Regulatory Actions and Compliance	</font><li><font face="Arial">	Information Systems and Reporting</font><li><font face="Arial">	Financial Stability and Insurance Coverage</font><li><font face="Arial">	Communications </font><li><font face="Arial">	Participant Education/Field Services Reps, Investment Advisory Services</font><li><font face="Arial">	Implementation</font><li><font face="Arial">	Investment Structure</font><li><font face="Arial">	Mutual Funds</font><li><font face="Arial">	Fixed Variable Annuities</font><li><font face="Arial">	Mutual Fund Window</font><li><font face="Arial">	Other Fees</font></ul></ul></ul></ul><font face="Arial">			</font><br><font face="Arial">	Upon completion of the final evaluations and negotiations, the Office of Benefit Services believes three of these vendors/offerors (Great West Retirement Services, TIAA-CREF, and VALIC) provide employees with the best array of investment options, competitive fees, and responsive member services, and is recommending contract award to these vendors.  The Selection Advisory Committee concurs with this assessment.  Of the three vendors/offerors recommended for contract award, only VALIC currently has a contract with FCPS for 403(b) plan services.  Great West Retirement Services currently has a contract with FCPS for 457(b) plan services, and TIAA-CREF, a vendor nationally recognized in the education marketplace, is not currently offered.  Contracts for five vendors that are currently in effect (ING Financial Advisors, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, Lincoln Financial Group, Financial Directors, and Horace Mann) will expire effective December 31, 2009, however, new enrollments to these plans will not be permitted after August 2009.</font><br><br><b><font face="Arial">RECOMMENDATION:</font></b><br><br><font face="Arial">	That the School Board approve the contract awards for providing IRS Section 403(b) Plan deferred compensation services for FCPS employees to Great West Retirement Services, TIAA-CREF and VALIC effective September 1, 2009, and through the duration of the three (3) year contract as recommended by the Office of Benefit Services and endorsed by the Selection Advisory Committee (SAC). </font><br><ul><ul><br></div>
