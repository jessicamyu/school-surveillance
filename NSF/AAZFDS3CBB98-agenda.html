<p><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif">National Education Association&#39;s (NEA) Read Across America, now in its <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="19th">20<span class="scayt-misspell-word">th</span></span> year, is an annual reading motivation and awareness program that calls for every child in every community to celebrate reading on or around Dr. Seuss&#39;s birthday.&nbsp; This year&rsquo;s celebration is based on the theme, <em><span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif">&ldquo;Grab your Hat and Read with the Cat!&quot;</span></em> to encourage students to delve into books to learn as much as possible while becoming lifelong readers.&nbsp; &nbsp;In cities and towns across the nation, teachers, teenagers, librarians, politicians, actors, athletes, parents, grandparents, and others develop NEA&#39;s Read Across America activities to bring reading excitement to children of all ages. Governors, mayors, and other elected officials recognize the role reading plays in their communities with proclamations and floor statements. Athletes and actors issue reading challenges to young readers. Teachers and principals seem to be more than happy to dye their hair green or wear Seuss-inspired costumes if it boosts their students&#39; reading.</span><o:p></o:p></p>

<div class="itembody"><p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Tonight I am honored to join with the board to recognize Kaitlyn Hyun, one of our multitalented seniors from Oakton HS. Earlier this academic year, Kaitlyn was crowned as Miss Teen of Virginia 2016 and went on to win third place (as second runner up) in the national Miss Teen of America Pageant.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Miss Teen of America is a scholastically-based pageant that recognizes young women ages 13-18 for their outstanding personal achievements, leadership abilities, and artistic, creative or athletic talents. The organization searches for well-rounded teenagers who are judged in six distinct categories: scholastic achievement, service to school and community, personal development, personality projection and poise in formal wear, a general awareness test and interview. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Ms. Hyun is a Renaissance student who clearly exemplifies the traits we are looking for in our portrait of a graduate. She is as an accomplished flutist and pianist, who plays in the Capitol Symphonic Youth Orchestra. </span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">One thing you will learn about her is that she draws upon her passions to serve the community. Along those lines, she serves as founder and manager of the Oakton Musical Ensemble, a group that visits and plays music at nursing homes. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">She is also an accomplished tennis player who serves as her team captain and has helped lead her team to state-level finals every year she&rsquo;s been at Oakton. She herself holds a state championship in tennis singles. Drawing on her passion to serve the community, she has hosted a tennis racket fundraiser for military families that raised over 30 rackets.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">In her spare time, she serves as Vice President of her senior class, is a member of the National Honor Society, English Honor Society and Math Honor society, is an editor of the Opus Literary Magazine, and has been honored for her writing and photography.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">I think all my colleagues will agree that Kaitlyn is an incredibly accomplished young woman, and no matter where she goes to college or what she majors in, we wish Ms. Hyun all the best as she graduates this year.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:9.0pt;">March is National Social Work Month and this year&rsquo;s theme is &ldquo;Social Workers Stand Up!<em>&rdquo;&nbsp; </em><span style="color:#333333;">Social workers tackle some of the toughest challenges facing our society. In every city and every community they develop solutions to make mental health and health care more available, to reduce poverty, to eliminate injustice and discrimination and to protect vulnerable children from harm.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:9.0pt;">Social workers contribute at all levels of society, working with individuals, families, and schools,&nbsp; to mediate conflict, foster positive relationships and create hope and opportunity for people in need.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;<span style="font-family:verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:9.0pt;">Social workers in Fairfax County Public Schools use their training, experience, and skills to provide services to children, families, and school staff members in the effort to remove personal and environmental obstacles to optimal student academic performance. Social workers are committed to helping every child achieve in school and become a self-sufficient, emotionally healthy, socially well-adjusted, productive member of society.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>March is National Athletic Training Month and this year&rsquo;s theme is <em><span style="font-family:verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:9.0pt;">&ldquo;Your protection is our priority,&rdquo;</span></span></em> an appropriate slogan reflecting the important role certified athletic trainers employed by Fairfax County Public Schools play in keeping our students safe.&nbsp; Through educational programs for students, parents and coaches, pre-season sports screenings and emergency planning, these nationally certified and state licensed medical professionals are dedicated to promoting the health and safety of our student-athletes before, during and after practices and competitions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The athletic healthcare services provided by certified athletic trainers include the prevention, recognition, evaluation, treatment, and rehabilitation of athletic injuries and illness.&nbsp; FCPS continues to be recognized as a leader in adolescent injury epidemiology research and sports-related concussion management for high school athletes.&nbsp; Our athletic trainers work collaboratively with parents, school staff and community medical providers to promote safe participation for over 25,000 athletic participants each year.&nbsp; In fact, during the 2015-16 school year, over 9,300 individual students received care from an FCPS Athletic Trainer, accounting for over 75,000 total visits to our 25 athletic training facilities.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>FCPS is nationally recognized as a leader among high school athletic training programs.&nbsp; Earlier this month, all 25 FCPS high schools were again designated as 1st Team Safe Sports Schools through the National Athletic Trainers&rsquo; Association, the second time all 25 schools have been recognized in this fashion.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>School Board Action Required</strong>: Decision</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Related To</strong>:&nbsp; Strategic Plan, Goal 1 Student Success </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Key Points</strong>:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Every three years VDOE allows any &ldquo;Special Purpose School&rdquo; to submit an alternative accreditation plan.&nbsp; Five schools in Fairfax County - Key Center, Kilmer Center, Mountain View Alternative High School, Bryant Alternative High School, and Fairfax Adult High School &ndash; once again are pursuing the approval of alternative accreditation plans in order to be able to be &ldquo;Fully Accredited&rdquo; in 2017-2018, 2018-2019, and 2019-2020. </span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Because the five schools listed above are classified as &ldquo;Special Purpose&rdquo; schools, serving unique populations of students for whom the measures of accreditation are inappropriate, staff in the Office of School Improvement at the Virginia Department of Education recommend that alternative accreditation plans be submitted to the Virginia Board of Education for approval.&nbsp; This recommendation is based on the Regulations Establishing Standards for Accrediting Public Schools in Virginia, Section 8 VAC 20-131-280.C. The regulation states:&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">&quot;Subject to the provisions of 8 VAC 20-131-350, the governing school board of special purpose schools such as those provided for in &sect; 22.1-26 of the Code of Virginia, Governor&rsquo;s schools, special education schools, alternative schools, or career and technical schools that serve as the student&#39;s school of principal enrollment may seek approval of an alternative accreditation plan from the Board of Education. Schools offering alternative education programs and schools with a graduation cohort of 50 or fewer students as defined by the graduation rate formula adopted by the board may request that the board approve an alternative accreditation plan to meet the graduation and completion index benchmark. Special purpose schools with alternative accreditation plans shall be evaluated on standards appropriate to the programs offered in the school and approved by the board prior to August 1 of the school year for which approval is requested. Any student graduating from a special purpose school with a Standard, Advanced Studies, or Modified Standard Diploma must meet the requirements prescribed in 8 VAC 20-131-50.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Recommendation</strong>:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">That the School Board approve the Alternative Accreditation Plan requests for Key Center, Kilmer Center, Mountain View Alternative High School, Bryant Alternative High School, and Fairfax Adult High School for submission to the Virginia Board of Education, as detailed in the agenda item.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>School Board Action Required:&nbsp; </strong>Information<strong> </strong></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Related To:</strong>&nbsp; School Board Policy 5011.3 Authority to Contract <strong>&nbsp; </strong></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Key Points:</strong></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">On February 1, 2017, proposals were received for RFP #17-012, for Electrical Installation Services for Portable Classroom Trailers.&nbsp; The Selection Advisory Committee (SAC) is evaluating the proposals in accordance with the criteria set forth in School Board Policy 8240.6.&nbsp; To handle the volume of electrical installations &nbsp;for portable classroom trailers, it is in the best interest of FCPS to engage multiple contractors as opposed to awarding a contract to one offerer.&nbsp; Awarding a contract to multiple contractors provides FCPS the opportunity to take advantage of the lowest price, creates flexibility and classroom readiness by the start of the next school year.&nbsp; Funding for these projects will be provided from either operating or bond funds.&nbsp; The SAC will recommend a list of qualified contractors for notice of award prior to the March 9, 2017, School Board meeting.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Recommendation:</strong></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">That the School Board authorize staff to issue a Notice of Award to multiple contractors for Electrical Installation Services for Portable Classroom Trailers, and authorize the Division Superintendent, or the Assistant Superintendent of Facilities and Transportation Services, to execute, deliver, and administer contracts on behalf of the School Board.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Key Points:</strong></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The World Languages Basal Instructional Materials Adoption Committee convened in October and November 2016 to review grades 7-12 Latin resources and make recommendations to the School Board by February 2017. These Latin resource recommendations&nbsp;to the School Board lag 1 year behind Spanish, French and German due to the lack of vendor submissions during the original RFP process held in fall 2015.&nbsp; A timeline of the process for the Latin basal resource review can be found in Attachment 1.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">In accordance with the Code of Virginia, regulations of the Virginia Board of Education, and Fairfax County Public Schools&rsquo; regulations, the Basal Instructional Materials Adoption Committee in conjunction with the Selection Advisory Committee and the Technical Advisory Committee has made the recommendations listed in attachment A.&nbsp; Additionally, committee rationales for recommended materials and community feedback received via comment sheets from review of hard copy texts and the online survey are provided in attachments B and C.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Recommendation:</strong></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">That the School Board approve the titles listed for Latin textbooks for Levels 1-3 as recommended by the World Language Basal Instructional Materials Adoption Committee and the Selection Advisory Committee, and approve the title listed for upper level materials (Levels 4, 5, AP/IB) as recommended resources for these levels.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Subject:&nbsp; </strong>Social Studies Basal Instructional Materials Approval </span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 116.25pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>School Board Action Required: </strong>Information&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Key Points:</strong></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40.5pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The Virginia Department of Education revised the Standards of Learning for History and Social Sciences in 2015.&nbsp;The social studies team in Instructional Services has been revising curriculum documents to align with these new standards and providing professional development for teachers and administrators about the revised SOLs which place an emphasis on the development of social studies skills to learn required content.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The contracts for instructional resources currently in use in FCPS schools expire during summer 2017.&nbsp;As a result, students and teachers would no longer have access to these resources without some action.&nbsp;Therefore in January 2016, Instructional Services began the process for new basal instructional materials as defined in FCPS Regulation 3004. </span></span></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">A timeline of the process for the social studies basal resource review can be found in Attachment A.&nbsp;On June 30, 2016 the School Board approved the committee members to review and recommend basal instructional materials for Social Studies. The Social Studies Basal Instructional Materials Adoption Committee convened in August and September 2016 to review resources for K- 12 that were submitted by vendors in response to a RFP for consideration as basal instructional materials for Social Studies. No titles for grade 4-Virginia Studies were reviewed by the committee due to the lack of submissions to the RFP.&nbsp; Instructional Services plans to issue a new RFP later this year for grade 4-Virginia Studies with the Community Review Committee to convene in fall 2017.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">In accordance with the Code of Virginia, regulations of the Virginia Board of Education, and Fairfax County Public Schools regulations, the Basal Instructional Materials Adoption committee in conjunction with the Selection Advisory Committee and the Technical Advisory Committee recommends the titles listed in Attachment B for adoption at the division level.&nbsp;Additionally, a summary of the committee rationales for the recommended materials and community input received are provided in attachments C and D.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Recommendation:</strong></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">That the School Board approve the titles listed for Kindergarten through grade 12 social studies, which does not include grade 4-Virginia Studies, as recommended by the Social Studies Basal Instructional Materials Adoption Committee and the Selection Advisory Committee.</span></span></p>
