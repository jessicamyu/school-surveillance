	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Laura Ashley Piper served as student representative to the Fairfax County School Board from 1986 to 1987.

<p style="text-align: center;">

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The School Board Character Award was initiated by former Student Representative to the School Board Chris Giovarelli and established by the Student Advisory Council in 2001. The Apple Federal Credit Union Education Foundation has generously funded the $500 award since 2007.&nbsp; The award is given to a junior or senior, who demonstrates a continuous record of high morals, strong integrity, and good character, and who is recognized as a role model for students in Fairfax County Public Schools in day-to-day behavior.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Jorge Douglas Romero Del Cid, a junior <em>a</em>t Lee High School, is the recipient of the 2015 School Board Character Award. </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Jorge truly embodies the traits required of the School Board Character Award. Jorge has not had a typical high school experience. In 2011, he left his parents and extended family in a country with conflict and turmoil and came to the United States with a dream of earning his high school diploma. When he arrived, he did not speak one word of English and had to adjust to a new country, a new culture, and a new language, all without the support of his parents and family. Jorge&rsquo;s goal was to learn to read and speak English as quickly as possible so he could advance academically and, after four years, he has successfully achieved this goal and excels at his studies. </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Jorge is an accomplished student in the field of Electrical Construction and Engineering at the Academy for Engineering and Scientific Technology and serves as a student ambassador. In addition to receiving several awards for outstanding performance, Jorge maintains an A average and has passed the first and second levels of the electrical apprenticeship exam. He is an intern at Mount Vernon Estates and works to ensure that the electrical system for George Washington&rsquo;s residence is operational and secure. </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Jorge is a role model and leader for other students, not only in school but also in his church and his community. He is active in his church youth group, has been involved in a community program that collects and distributes food to those less fortunate, and is an avid and talented soccer player. </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Jorge&rsquo;s willingness to accept difficult challenges, his strong sense of responsibility, and his commitment to succeed in the United States has led to his great success and provided significant opportunities for his future. He has always demonstrated an exceptional work ethic, high morals, strong integrity and admirable character and, as one of his nominators noted, &ldquo;Jorge is the epitome of what we want in a student and community member.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p>
	<br />
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Fairfax County Public Schools and the Fairfax County and Fairfax City Police Departments have established a mutually beneficial relationship for more than a decade. One of the hallmarks of this relationship has been the School Resource Officer (SRO) program. SROs help ensure a safe and peaceful learning environment for students, and provide school administrators and staff with the law enforcement resources and expertise necessary to maintain order, prevent truancy, and enforce the rules and codes of student conduct.<br />
	<br />
	A committee was created to establish and select the Distinguished School Resource Officer Award to annually recognize the efforts of outstanding SROs. &nbsp;The 2015 selection committee members were Tom Vaccarello, Director, Office of Safety and Security, Jim McLain, Coordinator, Office of Safety and Security, Doug Tyson, Region 1 Assistant Superintendent, and Byran Holland, Liaison Commander.</span></span></p>
<p>
	<br />
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Two other School Resource Officers were nominated by their principals. These nominees are stellar examples of the outstanding officers working in our schools. They should be very proud of their nomination.</span></span></p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">At the December 11, 2014, forum work session, the Board discussed the topic of defining the process used to establish the School Board&rsquo;s main motion to adopt the approved budget during the May regular School Board meeting.&nbsp; There was consensus to refer the issue to the Governance Committee, who would bring a recommendation to the full Board.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The Governance Committee discussed the topic on January 15, 2015, and reviewed two agenda options presented by staff that the Board used from FY 2012 to FY 2015 to adopt the approved budget at the second regular Board meeting in May.&nbsp; The Committee agreed that the options would be presented to the Board for further discussion.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">At the March 16, 2015, work session, the Board discussed the two options presented by the Governance Committee, and there was Board consensus to approve the following next steps:</span></span></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Budget Chair and Vice Chair to craft a new omnibus motion after presentation of the Superintendent&rsquo;s recommendation, receive majority support at the budget work session, and post an omnibus motion for action as the main budget motion.&nbsp; </span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The recommendation is to include the following information in the Strategic Governance Manual as a new <em>Appendix M</em>, and add a note to page 38, #3.e., Annual Work Calendar and Planning Cycle (to refer to the new <em>Appendix M</em>).</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><u>Agenda Format as Presented for New Business:</u></span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">At the first School Board meeting in May, the required revenue and expenditure adjustments will be listed first.&nbsp; Then a placeholder will show the amount required to balance the budget.&nbsp; Based on the discussion at the budget work session that is typically scheduled in late April or early May, the Superintendent&rsquo;s recommendations for eliminating the placeholder will be presented.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">For the second School Board meeting in May, the School Board will take action on the approved budget; the main motion language will be revised to include an omnibus motion. &nbsp;The omnibus motion will be a substitute for the placeholder and will include adjustments to balance the budget that the School Board Budget Chair and Vice Chair have determined have consensus. &nbsp;Any amendments would then be made to the main motion, which is the omnibus motion.</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The current version of Policy 1710 establishes nine standing citizen advisory committees to the School Board, setting forth their authority, responsibility, and representation.

All appointments shall be approved by the School Board.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">VDOT has initiated a legal proceeding in the Fairfax County Circuit Court to acquire a permanent utility easement, as well as a grading and temporary construction easement (collectively, the &quot;Easements&quot;) at Garfield Elementary School, in connection with the I-95 High Occupancy Toll (HOT) lanes.&nbsp; The Easements are located along the Old Keene Mill Road frontage of the Garfield site. </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The Office of Design and Construction has determined that the Easements have no negative impact on the operation of the school site. Legal counsel for FCPS and for VDOT are currently negotiating to determine the compensation to be paid by VDOT to FCPS.&nbsp; VDOT&rsquo;s initial appraisal value for the Easements was $7,200.00.</span></span></p>
