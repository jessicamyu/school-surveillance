<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Constitution Day and Citizenship Day are observed each year on September 17 to commemorate the signing of the Constitution on September 17, 1787, and &ldquo;recognize all who, by coming of age or by naturalization, have become citizens.&rdquo;&nbsp; Recent legislation has renamed the day as Constitution Day and Citizenship Day and urges proper observance of the day.&nbsp;This year, the official observance day is Monday, September 17, and is the&nbsp;231st&nbsp; anniversary of the nation&rsquo;s founding document.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All&nbsp;schools in&nbsp;FCPS&nbsp;will observe this day with activities that recognize the adoption of the United States Constitution and those who have become citizens under the Constitution.&nbsp; Schools will use a variety of curriculum resources to teach students about the importance of the Constitution and responsible citizenship.&nbsp; Throughout the school year, high school students will have an opportunity to participate in service learning projects related to responsible citizenship, which can lead to a Civics Seal on their diploma.</p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span lang="EN">Each year, Americans observe National Hispanic Heritage Month by celebrating the histories, cultures and contributions of Americans whose ancestors came from Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean and Central and South America. This observation started in 1968 as Hispanic Heritage Week under President Lyndon Johnson. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan expanded the observation period to 30-days starting on September 15 and ending on October 15. It was enacted into law August 17, 1988. </span></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span lang="EN">National Hispanic Heritage Month is a wonderful opportunity for our schools and community to celebrate various cultures and traditions, and a tangible reinforcement of the School Board&rsquo;s belief that &ldquo;Our diversity is a strength that creates resilient, open, and innovative global citizens.&rdquo; In FCPS, one in four of our students is of Hispanic Heritage, and boast ancestry from a variety of countries and cultures. These cultures in turn enrich our own school community. I encourage you to participate in the programs and events taking place during this time in your schools and community. </span></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span lang="EN">FCPS values its diversity and acknowledges that all people contribute to the well-being of the community. FCPS is fortunate to have many groups whose members work with our Hispanic and immigrant students empowering them to be the next generation of leaders and professionals. These include, but are not limited to, </span>our parent liaisons, the Hispanic Educators Association, Edu-Futuro, and Minority Student Achievement Oversight Committee.</span></span></p>

<div class="itembody"><p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The American Childhood Cancer Organization (or ACCO) has designated September as Childhood Cancer Awareness Month to spotlight the types of cancer that largely affect children, survivorship issues, and to help raise funds for research and family support.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">According to ACCO, 15,780 children under the age of 21 are diagnosed with cancer every year in the United States; approximately 1/4 of them will not survive the disease. A diagnosis turns the lives of the entire family upside down. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">ACCO offers support, information and advocacy through their community of families, survivors, and friends affected by childhood and adolescent cancer. &nbsp;They are dedicated to improving the lives of children and families living with childhood cancer and engaged in this life-altering struggle.&nbsp; FCPS students being treated for childhood cancer participate in home-bound instruction while they are undergoing treatment or recuperating.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">We are joined tonight by long-time teacher Jay Coakley&nbsp;retired from FCPS after 30 years of teaching physical education, and returned to FCPS as a part-time elementary physical education teacher at Woodburn Elementary. &nbsp;It was at Woodburn where John met a little girl named Ellie, who had been diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the spring of 2013. By the time she entered kindergarten that fall, Ellie had lost most of her hair and was wearing hats to school every day.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Jay noticed her affinity for &ldquo;fun and cheery hats&rdquo; and organized a hat drive to provide Ellie with a broader selection of hats, and Ellie&rsquo;s Hats was born!&nbsp; Now thanks to the hard work of the individuals who, like Jay, took an interest in Ellie and her hats, thousands of kids across the country who are battling cancer have received new hats and so much more. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">On behalf of the Board, I&rsquo;d like to encourage everyone to visit the website for Ellie&rsquo;s Hats at ellieshats.org and the American Childhood Cancer Organization at acco.org, to learn how you can help.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="vertical-align: top;"><span style="color: black;"><span verdana="">The current version of Regulation 3009, Challenged Library and Instructional Materials, establishes an Interdepartmental Review Committee to review challenges of library and instructional materials by residents. Six School Board members (on a rotating basis) will each select an individual to serve a one-year term on the Interdepartmental Review Committee. For 2018-2019 the Board members making appointments are Tamara Derenak Kaufax (Lee), Sandy Evans (Mason), Elizabeth Shultz (Springfield), Karen Keys-Gamarra (At-Large), Ryan McElveen (At-Large), and Ilryong Moon (At-Large). Last year the School Board district representatives from Braddock, Dranesville, Hunter Mill, Mount Vernon, Providence and Sully were selected to appoint individuals. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="vertical-align: top;"><span style="color: black;"><span verdana="">Two appointees will participate at each of the three levels of challenged materials: elementary, middle, and high school. The level will be determined by a random selection. If the deliberations involve multiple levels, a randomly selected School Board appointee from each involved level will participate. </span></span></span></span></span></p>
