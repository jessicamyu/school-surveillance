</div>

<div class="rightcol"></div>
<div class="itembody"><p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The School Board Character Award was initiated by former Student Representative to the School Board Chris Giovarelli and established by the Student Advisory Council in 2001. The Apple Federal Credit Union and its Foundation have generously funded this award.&nbsp; The award is given to a junior or senior who demonstrates a continuous record of high morals, strong integrity, and good character, and who is recognized as a role model for students in Fairfax County Public Schools in day-to-day behavior.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The recipient of the 2017 School Board Character award is <strong>Roza Yahya Ahmed Al-Barznji</strong>, a junior at Mt. View High School.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Roza embodies all of the traits showcased by this award and demonstrates them daily through her words and actions.&nbsp;She is a positive role model for her peers and a powerful example to the ESOL population within Mt. View High School. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Roza arrived at Mt. View High School as a refugee from Kurdistan with Level 2 ESOL. Although her English was limited, she quickly found her voice in photography by becoming a student journalist in Government class and a photographer for the school&rsquo;s newspaper. As Roza&rsquo;s skills in English progressed, she published several stories describing her personal journey as a Kurdish American, the plight of the Syrian people, the refugees in our communities and the value of mentoring in a school community. She also created a documentary on American Thanksgiving traditions after she interviewed three generations of a family.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">In addition to her work as the school photographer and for the school newspaper, Roza works as a special occasion photographer and volunteers at a local food bank. Roza&rsquo;s determination and exceptional work ethic are an inspiration to the whole FCPS community. According to one teacher, &ldquo;As a teacher I am excited about the learning we are doing together and the message that this outstanding student and young global citizen brings to all of us. She is resilient, curious and a dependable advocate for the truth that many seek to hide&rdquo;. Her high morals, strong integrity, and resilience epitomize the character traits we want to see in all of our students.&nbsp; Roza has earned and truly deserves the School Board Character Award.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Key Points:</strong></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The current version of Policy 1710 establishes nine standing citizen advisory committees to the School Board, setting forth their authority, responsibility, and representation. By policy, committee members &ldquo;shall be residents of Fairfax County or employees of Fairfax County Public Schools,&rdquo; and &ldquo;to the maximum extent possible, appointments made by School Board members should reflect the religious, cultural, and ethnic diversity of the areas they represent.&rdquo; Additional committee members are selected as provided for in the current version of Regulation 1710. All appointments shall be approved by the School Board.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Members of the citizen advisory committees serve one-year terms, as do the student representative&rsquo;s appointees. All terms begin in July and end in June.&nbsp; </span></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Members of the FECEP-Head Start Parent Policy committee and Title I District Advisory are selected according to federal mandates and are confirmed by the School Board each year in November.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Membership in the Facilities Planning Advisory Council (FPAC) is handled differently, as the terms vary.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>

<div class="leftcol">Meeting</div>
<div class="rightcol">Jun 8, 2017 - Regular Meeting</div>

<div class="itembody"><p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">During its July 28, 2016, regular meeting, the Fairfax County School Board passed a motion:&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The committee broke into subcommittees to answer the School Board&rsquo;s different charges as follows: </span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><em>I move that the School Board recognize the need for further consideration of community concerns about the name of J.E.B. Stuart High School.<br />
<br />
I further move that the Board recognize that renaming the school to one more reflective of the community it serves may be a laudable goal. The process for evaluating whether the name should be changed should engage the community in a public and transparent manner.<br />
<br />
I further move that the School Board approve the creation of an Ad hoc Committee to consider renaming J.E.B. Stuart High School to consist of students, parents, Stuart community members, alumni, and business and community leaders to be chosen by the Superintendent in consultation with the Full Board. The Superintendent and FCPS staff will facilitate the group&rsquo;s work. The working group will weigh the pros and cons of a name change; continue to ensure public engagement and determine the extent of support for change; explore public-private partnerships to finance any name change; ways to prevent added burdens on the school&rsquo;s booster clubs, PTSA and Stuart school administration; the best method for transitioning from an old name to a new one; proper record retention; and the best timing for such a change, if such a change is approved by the Board. The working group will also provide ideas for ways to honor and preserve the school&rsquo;s history, traditions and past achievements and to memorialize its decades as J.E.B. Stuart High School. The working group will report on its findings and recommendations to the School Board by March 2017.</em></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The committee broke into subcommittees to answer the School Board&rsquo;s different charges as follows: </span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Subcommittee 1 &ndash; Weigh the pros and cons of a name change</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Subcommittee 2 &ndash; Determine the support for a change</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Subcommittee 3 and 4 &ndash; Explore public private partnerships to finance any name change and to identify ways to prevent added burdens on the schools booster clubs, PTSA and school administration</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Originally, the committee was scheduled to submit their reports in March, however, the committee needed more time to work through the charges, and a new completion date of May 24, 2017 was recommended. </span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The Ad Hoc Committee submitted their reports to the Superintendent on May 24, 2017 and were in turn submitted to the School Board for their consideration. There are seven reports: one pro name change and one against name change from each of the subcommittees and one individual who submitted their own. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Recommendation:</span></span></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The School Board will now consider the reports and what action, if any, they will take on this item. In the work session on June 12, the School Board will hear from members of the Ad Hoc Committee. The School Board will make a determination for further action. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Key Points:</strong></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">On April 27, the School Board approved ERFC Plan modifications effective July 1, 2017.&nbsp; The School Board directed the ERFC Board of Trustees to initiate the process to implement the ERFC Plan modifications with the amended Plan documents submitted to the School Board for approval by June 2017.&nbsp; The Plan amendments are summarized below:&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><em>ERFC</em> and <em>ERFC 2001</em> Plan Documents</strong><br />
<br />
Proposed amendments to the <em>ERFC</em> and <em>ERFC 2001</em> Plans provide for a 4 percent interest rate on accumulated contributions for periods after June 30, 2017. The rate is reduced from the 5 percent currently credited on accumulated contributions.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">Proposed administrative amendments to the <em>ERFC</em> and <em>ERFC 2001</em> Plans clarify that the cost-of-living adjustment is calculated without regard to any temporary adjustments to a member&rsquo;s benefit and update the Internal Revenue Code compensation limit.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><em>ERFC 2001</em> Plan Document</strong></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">Proposed amendments that are applicable to members who first enter eligible employment on or after July 1, 2017, include:&nbsp; instituting retirement eligibility requirements that age and service equal 90 or attainment of full Social Security retirement age with at least five years of service; increasing the period for calculating the final average salary from 3 years to 5 years; and changing the cost-of-living adjustment to equal 100 percent of the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U) for the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area that includes Fairfax County with a cap of 4 percent.&nbsp; In circumstances where the ERFC Board of Trustees is allowed to suspend cost of living adjustments (COLAs), the Board may not reduce the COLAs that were previously granted below 3 percent for members hired prior to July 1, 2017, or the lesser of 4 percent or the increase in the CPI-U for members hired on or after July 1, 2017.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">Proposed administrative amendments to the <em>ERFC 2001</em> Plan document include:</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">clarifications that a member may nominate a beneficiary consistent with administrative procedures adopted by the ERFC Board of Trustees and that a spouse who is eligible for a 100 percent and a 50 percent survivor option (Options A and B) will receive benefits under the 100 percent option (Option A) in the event of an active member death.&nbsp; Other administrative amendments provide that a member who leaves eligible employment and returns to work without receiving a refund of contributions will be treated as hired before July 1, 2017, for all purposes under the Plan; conversely, a member who leaves eligible employment, receives a refund and returns to work will be treated as hired on or after July 1, 2017, even if the member redeposits the withdrawn contributions. </span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;">&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Recommendation:</strong></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">That the School Board approve proposed restated plan documents for <em>ERFC </em>and <em>ERFC 2001.&nbsp; </em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">An alumnus of North Springfield Elementary School, Clarence E. Goodson, IV (the &ldquo;Donor&rdquo;), has donated funding to US Soccer Foundation for the purchase and installation of a Mini Pitch play area (photograph attached) at his former school. The Donor chose to work through US Soccer Foundation, which plans to have the play area installed during the summer months so that it will be completed and available for use at the beginning of the 2017-18 school year.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The Office of Design and Construction Services has reviewed and approved the product specifications, and will oversee the installation process.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">This arrangement is in the nature of an in-kind Grant, which will be evidenced by a written Grant Agreement, pursuant to which US Soccer Foundation will provide a mini pitch at North Springfield Elementary School.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The surface of the Mini Pitch play area and the associated windscreen will display a rendering of the School&rsquo;s mascot as well as the name/logo of the Donor and US Soccer Foundation (attached).</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Recommendation:</strong></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">That the School Board approve the installation of a Mini Pitch play area (with associated logos), per the drawings and specifications previously submitted to and approved by the Office of Design and Construction Services, and authorize the Division Superintendent or the Assistant Superintendent of Facilities and Transportation Services, (either of whom may act without the other) to negotiate, execute, and administer on behalf of the School Board the Grant Agreement and any related agreements in connection with the Mini Pitch at North Springfield Elementary School.</span></span></p>
