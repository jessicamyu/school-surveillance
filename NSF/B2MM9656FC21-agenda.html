<p><strong><u>Read Across America Day &ndash; March 2, 2019</u></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Education Association&#39;s (NEA) Read Across America, now in its 20th year, is an annual reading motivation and awareness program that calls for every child in every community to celebrate reading on or around Dr. Seuss&#39;s birthday. This year&rsquo;s celebration is based on the theme,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Grab your Hat and Read with the Cat!&quot;</em>&nbsp;to encourage students to delve into books to learn as much as possible while becoming lifelong readers. In cities and towns across the nation, teachers, teenagers, librarians, politicians, actors, athletes, parents, grandparents, and others develop NEA&#39;s Read Across America activities to bring reading excitement to children of all ages.</p>
