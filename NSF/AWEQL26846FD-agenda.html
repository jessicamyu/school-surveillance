<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><b><span verdana="">Summary/Background:</span></b></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span verdana="">All of the FY18 accounts have been closed subject to the annual audit. A summary of the revenue and expenditure variances is provided for each of the nine funds. All comparisons are against the FY18 Third Quarter Budget Review.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span verdana="">In the School Operating Fund, after accounting for the revenue variance and the FY19 budgeted beginning balance, the flexibility reserve, fuel contingency, textbook reserve, and other commitments, the FY18 funds available total $31.7 million.</span><span arial=""><ins cite="mailto:Willstatter,%20Tracie%20E" datetime="2018-07-05T13:41"> </ins></span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span verdana="">Revenue variances begin on page 1 of the agenda attachment, and FY18 actual total funds available are $5.8 million less, or 0.2 percent, of the FY18 Third Quarter Budget Review projection. State Aid for FY18 totals $437.9 million, which is $0.8 million less than budgeted, and sales tax receipts total $196.9 million, $0.2 million more than budgeted. Federal revenue totals $45.8 million, which is $5.8 million less than budgeted primarily as a net result of unspent multiyear grant awards that will be carried forward and re-appropriated in FY19. Other revenue receipts, including tuition, fees, other service charges, and miscellaneous revenue, are $0.6 million more than the third quarter estimate.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span verdana="">Expenditure variances on page 2 of the agenda attachment, total $37.5 million. The total expenditure variance of $37.5 million is 1.3 percent of the FY18 Third Quarter Budget and is largely attributed to unanticipated lapse and turnover of $18.4 million from salaries, and $11.3 million from employee benefits. Additionally, $2.2 million from other accounts was unexpended. Multiyear unspent federal grant funds of $5.6 million is carried forward and re-appropriated for FY19.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span verdana="">As a result of the revenue and expenditure variances, the total funding available from FY18 totals $31.7 million. This agenda item includes recommendations for FY19 expenditure adjustments. Items identified as part of the FY19 Approved Budget include placeholder funding of $1.1 million for a one-year step increase for grandfathered teachers on the BA lanes and classroom instructional support employees as well as $0.8 million for a bonus for employees who did not receive a salary increase in FY19. Prior committed priorities and requirements include $3.6 million to continue FCPS&rsquo; annual commitment to allocate funding from year-end to major maintenance projects; and $40,338 to address a shortfall in Adult and Community Education (ACE). Other funding to support the online campus program is included at $0.6 million.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span verdana="">On June 18, 2018, staff provided the results of an internal security review and made recommendations to the School Board for opportunities for improvement. FY18 non-recurring, year-end funds of $1.0 million were recommended for the replacement of classroom locks as well as 8.0 positions to provide greater school-based training and increased frequency of training. Additionally, $2.2 million was recommended to fund 18.0 positions for mental health support and threat assessment follow-up. The positions recommended for safety and security are recurring and funded with additional state revenue.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span verdana="">All of the remaining funding available, $24.6 million, is recommended to be set aside for the FY20 budgeted beginning balance. The FY19 beginning balance is $24.2 million.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span verdana="">Changes to other School Board funds are detailed in the attachment.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That the School Board approve the revenue and expenditure adjustments as detailed in the agenda item.</p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Problem Statement:</strong></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span lang="EN"><span style="color:black">In accordance with its policy, the School Board decides on an annual basis whether or not to cooperate with the Virginia State Department of Education to operate Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJHSST) as a regional school. The recommendation to continue to operate TJHSST as a regional school is based on the following advantages:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="color:black"><span lang="EN">Additional state funding for the regional school. <u>The estimate for FY 2019 is $3,477,151. The tuition for out-of-county students is estimated at $5,610,843.</u></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="color:black"><span lang="EN">Cooperation with participating school divisions to provide their qualified students the opportunity to attend the specialized high school.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="color:black"><span lang="EN">Status the Governor&rsquo;s School designation provides in attracting corporate sponsors throughout the Northern Virginia area.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="color:black"><span lang="EN">Greater visibility throughout the region, the Commonwealth, and the nation under the umbrella of the state initiative.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span lang="EN"><span style="color:black">The disadvantages of not continuing as a regional school are loss of state funding and possible disruption of relationships with the Virginia Department of Education and the participating school divisions.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Outcome:</strong></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span lang="EN"><span style="color:black">To continue to cooperate with the Virginia State Department of Education to operate Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJHSST) as a regional school.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">In the current version of the School Board&rsquo;s Strategic Governance Manual, committees are created to perform delegated functions or to advise the Board. The Board may also designate one or more of its members to serve as a liaison in connection with a specified activity or area of interest to the Board. Board liaisons and committees may prepare alternatives, implications, or recommendations for consideration by the full Board.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><b>Recommendation:</b><br />
<br />
That the School Board confirm committee liaisons and assignments, as detailed in the agenda item.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span verdana="">In 2017, the FCPS School Board adopted basal resources for K-12 social studies in FCPS with the exception of grade 4 Virginia Studies. FCPS issued two RFPs for Virginia Studies. The first RFP, which was issued in 2016 within the timeline for the 2017 adoption, yielded only one submission, so a second RFP for grade 4 Virginia Studies was issued in 2017. The second RFP yielded two submissions but neither publication met the needs of FCPS according to the basal resources review committee. </span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span verdana="">In March 2018, the Virginia Department of Education issued a list of approved textbooks for use in history and social science including grade 4 Virginia Studies. There are two textbooks on the state approved list: one title was reviewed previously by the FCPS review committee and not recommended. The basal resources review committee reconvened and conducted a review of the second title: </span><i><span verdana="">Our Virginia: Past and Present</span></i><span verdana=""> (Five Ponds Press)<i>. </i>As a result of extensive review, the Social Studies Basal Instructional Materials Adoption Committee recommends adoption of <i>Our Virginia: Past and Present</i> (Five Ponds Press) for use in grade 4 Virginia Studies beginning in the 2018-2019 school year.</span></span></span></p>
