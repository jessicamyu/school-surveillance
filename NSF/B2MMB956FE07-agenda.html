<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The American Alliance for Theater and Education has designated March as Theater In Our Schools Month to celebrate and increase public awareness of the benefits of theater education for youth development.&nbsp; The theme is &quot;Fostering a Culture of Creativity&quot;.&nbsp; Theater education has the power to raise academic achievement and to stimulate innovation and creativity among students.&nbsp; The Alliance encourages citizens to celebrate the positive impact of theater in the classroom and to remember that all students should have access to quality theater education in their lives. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Music in Our Schools Month - March 2019</strong></u></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>March has been officially designated by the National Association for Music Education for the observance of Music In Our Schools Month, the time of year when music education becomes the focus of schools across the nation.&nbsp; This year&#39;s theme is &quot;All Music, All People!&quot; and is designed to raise awareness of the importance of music education for all children and to remind citizens that school is where all children should have access to music.&nbsp;&nbsp;It also is an opportunity for music teachers to bring their music programs to the attention of the school and the community and to display the benefits school music brings to students of all ages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Youth Art Month - March 2019</strong></u></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Art education contributes powerful educational benefits to all elementary and secondary students. Art education develops students&#39; creative problem-solving and critical thinking abilities; teaches sensitivity to beauty, order, and other expressive qualities; gives students a deeper understanding of multicultural values and beliefs; and brings to life what students learn in other subjects.&nbsp; The theme for Youth Art Month 2019&nbsp;is &ldquo;Your Art, Your Story.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The Fairfax County School Board believes that support should be given to art teachers as they strengthen art education in schools and communities, and all citizens are urged to take an interest in and give full support to quality school art programs for children and youth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>National Sleep Awareness Week - March 10-16, 2019</strong></u></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The National Sleep Foundation is celebrating its annual Sleep Awareness Week March 10-16, 2019, to raise awareness of the health benefits of sleep and its importance to safety and productivity. This year&#39;s theme &quot;Begin with Sleep&quot; highlights the importance of good sleep health for individuals to best achieve their personal, family, and professional goals.&nbsp; The National Sleep Foundation believes the value of a good night&#39;s sleep which carries in to one&#39;s day to improve not just health, but mood, productivity, well-being and overall quality of life. &nbsp; Most of us know that getting a good night&rsquo;s sleep is important, but too few of us actually make those eight or so hours a priority. So many of us have forgotten what &ldquo;being really, truly rested&rdquo; feels like. To further complicate matters, stimulants like coffee and energy drinks, alarm clocks, and external lights, including those from electronic devices, interfere with our natural sleep/wake cycle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sleep needs vary across ages and are especially impacted by lifestyle and health. To determine how much sleep you need, it&#39;s important to examine what lifestyle factors are affecting the quality and quantity of your sleep such as work schedules and stress.&nbsp;For more information on healthy sleep, visit the National Sleep Foundation&rsquo;s website at&nbsp;<a href="http://sleep.org/" target="_blank">Sleep.org</a>.</p>

<div class="itembody"><p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="line-height:107%">On February 13, Fairfax County Public Schools participated in Crossing Guard Appreciation Day, a statewide event, as a way to say thank you to those individuals who help students cross the street safely on their way to and from school.&nbsp; We are grateful for the 80 crossing guards who manage 174 school-related crossings every day.&nbsp; Crossing guards, who are actually employees of the Fairfax County Police Department, do so much for our students and families and are often among the first adults to interact with students each day.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t thank them enough for their daily efforts to watch over and protect our students.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="line-height:107%">Tonight, I am pleased to recognize Mr. Joe McDonald, who was recently selected as one of Virginia&rsquo;s Most Outstanding Crossing Guards in 2018.&nbsp; He is one of six crossing guards to receive this honor.&nbsp; Joe McDonald is a familiar sight to many in Fairfax County Public Schools as he performs his duties flawlessly and greets students every day at Coates Elementary School.&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="line-height:107%">As you may know, Coates ES has a large population of students who walk to school, so Joe&rsquo;s post is a busy one.&nbsp; Additionally, Joe works on a regular basis as a crossing guard at Langston Hughes MS and Hutchison ES, and fills in as needed at South Lakes HS.&nbsp; Like other dedicated crossing guards, Joe McDonald can be found at his post in all kinds of weather, helping children to cross the street safely, assisting parents with negotiating the kiss and ride areas, and managing the buses.&nbsp; Joe has been a crossing guard for 8 years now and has built relationships with parents, teachers, administrators, and students during that time.&nbsp; He says he finds the job to be very rewarding because it gives him an opportunity to get to know people and to develop a bond and trust with the students and parents.&nbsp; Joe McDonald is very much an integral part of the community, giving of himself in his spare time.&nbsp; In fact, he is part of the mentoring program at Coates ES, where he mentors two sets of boys at Coates ES on Tuesdays and two sets of girls at Hutchison ES.&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="line-height:107%">To keep himself busy between his morning and afternoon crossing responsibilities, Joe McDonald volunteers on Wednesdays in the Fair Oaks Hospital post-surgery care unit.&nbsp; You can find Joe volunteering with the City of Fairfax Fire Department where he helps with administrative chores on Thursdays and with bingo on Fridays.&nbsp; With all that he is doing, Joe manages to save some of his time and energy on Mondays for ice hockey lessons so that he can keep young and stay in shape. Bravo!</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="line-height:107%">Please join me in congratulating Joe McDonald on being selected as a Virginia Most Outstanding Crossing Guard.&nbsp; He is truly deserving of this honor and of our thanks for keeping a watchful eye on our students.&nbsp; He is a fine example of a caring, contributing member of our community.&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="background:white"><span verdana="">This agenda item is provided to review the current FY 2019 budget and to make revisions as necessary. The FY 2019 Third Quarter Budget Review reports on activity and requests that have been made since the School Board&rsquo;s Midyear Budget Review that was approved on December 20, 2018.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="background:white"><span verdana="">Recommended School Operating Fund revenue adjustments reflect a net decrease of $0.2 million due to a decrease in state revenue for National Board-Certified Teacher (NBCT) pass-through payments based on the number of FCPS teachers eligible to receive a stipend from the state in FY 2019.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="background:white"><span verdana="">Recommended School Operating Fund expenditure adjustments reflect a net decrease of $4.6 million resulting from $4.3 million staffing reserve savings as of the January staffing review and $0.2 million adjustment for the NBCT payments.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="background:white"><span verdana="">These third quarter revenue and expenditure changes result in available funding of $4.3 million.&nbsp; It is recommended that this available funding be added to the FY 2020 beginning balance to provide $1.0 million for a revised BA lane teacher scale and $3.3 million for one-time staffing reserve carryover.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="background:white"><span verdana="">Changes to other School Board funds are detailed in the attachment. Also, attached is an update on the status of grants for FY 2019.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">1.

More specifically, the following two metrics would be expanded to include all Students with Disabilities, rather than excluding those receiving Category B, Level 2 services, so that the Strategic Plan data better represents all FCPS Students with Disabilities:</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="background:white"><span verdana="">Recommended School Operating Fund revenue adjustments reflect a net decrease of $0.2 million due to a decrease in state revenue for National Board-Certified Teacher (NBCT) pass-through payments based on the number of FCPS teachers eligible to receive a stipend from the state in FY 2019.</span></span></span></span></p>
