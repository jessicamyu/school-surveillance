<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Americans of Asian and Pacific ancestry have made significant contributions to the history and development of the United States in many fields of endeavor such as science, commerce, the arts, and the humanities. The Fairfax County School Board recognizes that an understanding of these contributions should be an integral part of the year-round education of all students.<br />
	<br />
	Since 1992, the President of the United States has proclaimed May to be Asian- and Pacific-American Heritage Month and has chosen this month to pay tribute to the generations of Asian and Pacific Islanders who have enriched American&rsquo;s history and are instrumental in its future success.</span></span></p>

	<br />
	School Nurse Day was established in 1972 to foster a better understanding of the role of school nurses in the educational setting.&nbsp; This annual event recognizes the contributions that school nurses make every day to improve the health and success of our nation&rsquo;s children.&nbsp; This year&rsquo;s theme, &ldquo;The School Nurse:&nbsp; Caring for Others, Caring for Ourselves,&rdquo; reflects the significant roles that school nurses have in health care in their school communities, as well as in modeling health and resiliency.<br />
	<br />
	School nursing is a specialized practice of professional nursing that advances the health and well-being of students and is an integral part of a quality school health program. School nurses promote health, safety, prevention, and wellness; &nbsp;intervene with actual and potential health problems; and provide case management services.&nbsp; They are an invaluable bridge connecting health care providers, public health, and families.<br />
	<br />
	The school system works closely with the Fairfax County Health Department to provide quality services to the children of Fairfax County Public Schools and recognized May 7 as School Nurse Day in Fairfax County.</span></span></p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Since 1927, the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) has celebrated Better Hearing and Speech Month every year in May. The theme this year is &ldquo;Identify the Signs,&rdquo; an effort to educate the public about the warning signs of communication disorders. This annual event provides opportunities to promote services that can improve the quality of life for those who experience problems with speaking and listening. An estimated 42 million people have communication disorders and they impact one in ten families.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Currently, Fairfax County Public Schools provides speech and language services to more than 10,000 students.&nbsp; Audiologists and special education teachers also serve more than 500 deaf and hard of hearing students in class-based programs, via base school itinerant services, and in early childhood programs.&nbsp; FCPS annually observes and celebrates Better Hearing and Speech Month and encourages all citizens in our school community to recognize the efforts, dedication, and skills of the speech-language clinicians, audiologists, and teachers of students who are deaf and hard of hearing. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The 2014-2015 Section 611, Part B application estimates revenue to Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) of $32,313,328. This amount is equal to the final 2013-2014 award as stated in by <a href="http://www.doe.virginia.gov/administrators/superintendents_memos/2013/189-13.shtml">Superintendent&rsquo;s memo #189-13</a> dated July 26, 2013 (revised August 23, 2013). Estimated expenditures include cost associated with maintaining a mandatory 15% set-aside for Coordinated Early Intervening Services (CEIS), and a mandatory private school set-aside of 0.5%.&nbsp; Section 611, Part B, award will fund a total of 417.1 FTE positions.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:2.0in;">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The Fairfax County Department of Public Works &amp; Environmental Services Storm Water Planning Division (SWP) approached the Office of Design and Construction to initiate a Storm Water Enhancement Project (SWEP) on the George C. Marshall High School campus during the renovation project.&nbsp; This initiative is part of an on-going collaboration between SWP and D&amp;C to identify and install storm water facilities on FCPS property that will help to meet the County&rsquo;s future MS-4 permit obligations.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The SWEP consists of the installation of a large below-grade cistern (concrete tank) that will intercept the piped storm water collected from the entire campus and building.&nbsp; The water captured by the cistern will be filtered, sanitized, and used to irrigate the existing natural turf athletic fields.&nbsp; The work requires replacement of existing storm sewer pipes, installation of a large underground cistern, installation of a small building to house the pumps and other equipment; installation of a brand-new irrigation system on all natural turf athletic fields, installation of a paved access road to the pump building from the parking lot; installation of a new water main to the pump building to be used during periods of insufficient rainfall; installation of an electric service; and installation of an internet connection in order to monitor the pump operation remotely.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">SWP has committed to fund the entire construction of the Cistern Project.&nbsp; They have also committed to monitoring and maintaining the new facility.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Dustin Construction Inc. (the Contractor currently in charge of the renovation of Marshall High School) has submitted a proposed change order in the amount of $2,057,460.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">To-date, SWP has transferred a total of $2,072,175 to D&amp;C to fund this project.</span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Recommendation:</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">That the School Board authorize the Division Superintendent, or Assistant Superintendent of Facilities and Transportation Services, to execute the <span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Storm Water Enhancement Project </span></span>Contract Change Order on behalf of the School Board, as detailed in the agenda item, and as shown on the County approved site plan to Dustin Construction Inc. for the amount of $2,057,460.</span></span></p>
