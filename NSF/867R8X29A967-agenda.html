Templin, President, Northern Virginia Community College</font></ul></ul><div align="center"><br><b><font size="4" face="Arial">Fairfax County Public Schools </font></b><br><b><font size="4" face="Arial">HIGH SCHOOLS OF THE FUTURE </font></b></div><br><font size="4" face="Arial">Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) is beginning to explore a new approach to increasing learning opportunities for all high school students. The approach involves:</font><br><br><font size="4" face="Symbol">·	</font><font size="4" face="Arial">Creating academic specialty programs at all high schools.</font><br><font size="4" face="Symbol">·	</font><font size="4" face="Arial">Using dual-enrollment strategies to offer high school students multiple opportunities to pursue higher education and technical certification during their senior year of high school.</font><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Arial">Academic Specialty Programs and Professional Technical Academies.</font></b><font size="4" face="Arial">  Currently, every FCPS high school offers either the advanced placement (AP) or international baccalaureate (IB) program.  However, current transportation challenges and diverse bell schedules make it</font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font><font size="4" face="Arial">difficult for many students to access unique course offerings, including the professional technical academies, that are offered at other high schools. </font><br><br><font size="4" face="Symbol">·	</font><font size="4" face="Arial">Proposal:  In support of Targets 3, 5, and 6, identify an academic specialty program for each high school.  Each program could be offered at multiple locations throughout the school division thereby increasing options for students to participate in a specific program and reducing transportation issues. Academic specialties to be considered would include but not be limited to:</font><br><br><font size="4" face="Courier New">o	</font><font size="4" face="Arial">Humanities</font><br><font size="4" face="Courier New">o	</font><font size="4" face="Arial">International Studies</font><br><font size="4" face="Courier New">o	</font><font size="4" face="Arial">Social Sciences</font><br><font size="4" face="Courier New">o	</font><font size="4" face="Arial">Performing Arts</font><br><font size="4" face="Courier New">o	</font><font size="4" face="Arial">Visual Arts</font><br><font size="4" face="Courier New">o	</font><font size="4" face="Arial">Science and Technology</font><br><br><font size="4" face="Symbol">·	</font><font size="4" face="Arial">Proposal:	  In support of Target 7, increase the access for students to professional technical studies (PTS) programs.  Currently many PTS programs are only offered at one school.  Having multiple sites offering the same PTS courses would allow students to attend a school geographically close to their home.  It would also allow students to attend the PTS program full time instead of being bused midday from their base school.  The choice to enroll in a particular academic specialty program on a full-time basis could be made in grade 9, 10 or 11.</font><br><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Arial">Dual Enrollment.</font></b><font size="4" face="Arial">  Governor Warner recently launched a </font><i><font size="4" face="Arial">Senior Year Plus</font></i><font size="4" face="Arial"> initiative transforming the senior year of high school by offering new options for students to get a jump-start on earning college credits or achieving an industry certification.  Locally, George Mason University (GMU) and Northern Virginia Community College (NOVA) are collaborating on a dual-admission program that would restructure higher education in Northern Virginia.  This initiative creates a unified and seamless system that allows students to start as early as the twelfth grade in a program that offers students the opportunity to begin college work, matriculate to NOVA, and then graduate with a GMU diploma.  As evidenced by the increasing numbers of FCPS students successfully completing AP and IB programs, we have a substantial number of students who are interested in and capable of successfully completing college-level work.</font><br><br><font size="4" face="Symbol">·	</font><font size="4" face="Arial">Proposal:  In support of Target 3, implement Governor Warner&#8217;s </font><i><font size="4" face="Arial">Senior Year Plus</font></i><font size="4" face="Arial"> initiative and the NOVA/GMU dual-enrollment program to offer FCPS students additional options for matriculation to college credit programs or technical certifications starting in their senior year of high school.</font><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Arial">Next Steps</font></b><br><font size="4" face="Arial">FCPS staff is conducting a study of comparable programs, both locally and across the nation, to learn how they may benefit the students of FCPS.  For example, Prince William County Public Schools has implemented an academic specialization program and open enrollment in all of their high schools. </font><br><br><font size="4" face="Arial">Issues needing further discussion and direction include:</font><br><br><font size="4" face="Symbol">·	</font><font size="4" face="Arial">How large should programs be at each site?</font><br><font size="4" face="Symbol">·	</font><font size="4" face="Arial">Where should the programs be located?</font><br><font size="4" face="Symbol">·	</font><font size="4" face="Arial">What courses and programs should be offered at each site?</font><br><font size="4" face="Symbol">·	</font><font size="4" face="Arial">What are the financial and human resources needed to implement and operate the programs?</font><br><font size="4" face="Symbol">·	</font><font size="4" face="Arial">The length of the planning process for the programs.</font><br><br><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">1</font><br><div align="center"><b><font size="4" face="Arial">NOVA/Mason Dual Admission Program</font></b><br><b><font size="4" face="Arial">(DRAFT 09-15-04)</font></b><br></div><br><font size="4" face="Arial">Over this decade more than 50,000 additional students are expected seek admission to Virginia&#8217;s colleges and universities.  A substantial portion of those students reside in Northern Virginia.  If the college-going rate remains what it is today, more than 15,000 additional Northern Virginia residents each year will be seeking to continue their educations.  Where will they attend college?</font><br><br><font size="4" face="Arial">Northern Virginia Community College and George Mason University are at their maximum capacity given current funding levels.  Even with significant additional funding, the requirements for enrolling such a large number of students are daunting.  What is needed is a strategy that targets the deployment of new financial resources and restructures education in Northern Virginia, creating a unified and seamless system that meets the growing challenges of higher education access while continuing to build an educational system committed to excellence.</font><br><br><font size="4" face="Arial">In an effort to respond to this challenge, Fairfax County Public Schools, Loudoun County Public Schools, Northern Virginia Community College and George Mason University are joining together to create two pilot programs to enhance access to baccalaureate higher education for qualified Northern Virginia high school graduates.  </font><ul></ul><b><font size="4" face="Arial">Early College Scholars Dual Admission Program</font></b><ul><ul><font size="4" face="Arial">Upon the completion of requirements in the eleventh grade, highly qualified Fairfax and Loudoun students will be jointly admitted to both Northern Virginia Community College and George Mason University to begin college-level work toward the baccalaureate during their senior year.  Admitted students will be designated Early College Scholars to receive college-level instruction through Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, Dual Enrollment, and other higher education programs resulting in the awarding of college credit that will be accepted for meeting NOVA/Mason degree requirements. Upon completion of their senior year with appropriate grades, Early College Scholars may graduate with both a high school diploma and completion of a significant portion of their college freshman year.  Dual Admission students will have the option to continue their collegiate experience at NOVA with a guarantee of continuing at Mason as juniors when they complete their NOVA Associate Degree requirements with strong academic performance.  Because college-level studies are to be initiated while still in high school, achievement of the baccalaureate may be possible in less than four years of full-time study.  Since Early College Scholars will have already been jointly admitted, there are no additional admission or transfer requirements following the award of the Associate Degree by NOVA, assuming the required cumulative grade point average has been achieved.</font></ul></ul><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Arial">NOVA/Mason Gateway Program</font></b><ul><ul><font size="4" face="Arial">High school graduates who do not participate in the Early College Scholars Program but who demonstrate the potential of strong academic performance may be admitted to the NOVA/Mason Gateway Program.  Students admitted to this program can receive freshman and sophomore level instruction through NOVA, and upon earning the Associate Degree with an appropriate cumulative grade point average, can receive their junior and senior-level instruction through Mason, resulting in the awarding of the baccalaureate after the equivalent of four years of full-time study. </font><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Arial">NOVA/Mason Scholarships </font></b><br><font size="4" face="Arial">Early College Scholars and Gateway students who complete the NOVA Associate Degree with exceptional academic performance will receive a one-time academic scholarship of $500 applicable to tuition and fees at George Mason University during their junior year of study.</font><br></ul></ul><font size="4" face="Arial">Early College Scholars and Gateway students will have special coursework and extracurricular experiences designed for them at both NOVA and Mason during their freshman and sophomore years. Students will be issued NOVA and Mason student ID cards and permitted use of the libraries and participation in some student activities at both institutions.  </font><br><br><b><font size="4" face="Arial">Proposed Pilot</font></b><br><font size="4" face="Arial">Beginning with the 2005-06 academic year, up to 1,000</font><font size="4" color="#FF0000" face="Arial"> </font><font size="4" face="Arial">appropriately qualified students will be admitted into the Early College Scholars Program, 700 from FCPS and 300 from LCPS.  Beginning with the 2006-07 academic year, up to 1,000 appropriately qualified students will be enrolled into the NOVA/Mason Gateway Program.  Both pilots will be contingent upon receipt of appropriate funding by the Commonwealth of Virginia.  By 2009-10 there is a projected increased capacity for 5000 full-time equivalent students enrolled in these programs. </font></div>
