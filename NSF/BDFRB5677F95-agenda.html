<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><u><strong><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Bullying Prevention Month- October</span></strong></u></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">In an effort to promote awareness of school bullying, the Virginia School Board Association Board of Directors has designated the month of October as VSBA Bullying Prevention Month. Childhood bullying is a significant problem nationwide. It can cause school absenteeism, mental and physical stress, poor school performance, poor self-esteem, and in some cases, school violence. Statistics show that 160,000 children in the United States miss school each day as a result of being bullied. School board members, superintendents, teachers, and parents play a critical role in creating a climate where bullying is not tolerated. It has been proven when adults and children stand together, bullying ends.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Fire Prevention Week 2019 focuses on the fact that in a fire, seconds count. The official theme, &quot;Not every hero wears a cape.&nbsp; Plan and practice your escape!&quot; This year&#39;s theme recognizes the everyday people who motivate their households to develop and practice a home fire escape plan; these seemingly basic behaviors can have life-saving impact.&nbsp; The campaign works to celebrate people of all ages who learn about home fire escape planning and practice, bring that information home, and spur their families to action.&nbsp; The theme also focuses on what a home escape plan entails and the value of practicing it.&nbsp; A home escape plan includes working smoke alarms on every level of the home, in every bedroom, and near al sleeping areas.&nbsp; It also includes two ways out of every room, usually a door and a window, with a clear path to an outside meeting place that&#39;s a safe distance from the home.&nbsp; Home escape plans should be practiced twice a year by all members of the household.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><u><strong>Mental Health Awareness Week - October 6-12,&nbsp;2019</strong></u></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;">The National Alliance on Mental Illness or NAMI and participants across the country are raising awareness of mental illness during Mental Illness Awareness Week which is October 6-12. Each year NAMI works to fight stigma, provide support, educate the public and advocate for equal care. <span style="font-family: verdana,sans-serif;">NAMI</span><span style="font-family: verdana,sans-serif;"> believes that mental illness issues are important to address year round, but highlighting these issues during Mental Health Awareness Week provides a time for people to come together and display the passion and strength of those working to improve the lives of the tens of millions of Americans affected by mental illness. This year&rsquo;s theme is Cure Stigma. There&#39;s a virus spreading across America, harming the 1 in 5 Americans affected by mental health conditions. It shames them into silence. It prevents them from seeking help. The virus we are talking about is stigma against people with mental health conditions. But there&#39;s good news, stigma is 100% curable. Compassion, empathy and understanding are the antidote. Your voice can spread the cure. </span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span verdana="">After commencing the project, ATC Corp discovered another (predecessor) playing surface beneath the current surface. Since this predecessor surface is severely cracked, the removal of this surface along with additional work is recommended. This additional work requires a change order of $141,714.50. OFM concludes that if the milling is not completed to the stone base, the cracks that we are seeing in the original tennis court surface would most likely transmit through the proposed new 2&rdquo; asphalt and surface. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="line-height:103%"><span verdana="">The Human Resources Department recommends that the School Board award a contract to George Mason University for the provision of the&nbsp;</span></span>Elementary Professional Development School (PDS) Internship Program.<span style="line-height:103%"><span verdana=""> &nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="line-height:103%"><span verdana="">The internship program provides George Mason University Elementary PDS students an opportunity to gain practical and clinical teaching experiences through semester or yearlong internships, to include substitute assignments.&nbsp; Over the past 5 years, FCPS has hosted an average of 50 elementary PDS students annually. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="line-height:103%"><span verdana="">The internship program benefits FCPS by deeply engaging local, highly qualified teacher candidates to the school division resulting in highly qualified teacher hires. Other benefits to the program include built in subbing hours that allow for year-long participants to sub for FCPS for up to 45 days helping to combat FCPS&rsquo; subbing shortage. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="line-height:103%"><span verdana="">The internship program also promotes a more robust student teaching experience resulting in higher quality teaching skills and outcomes. The vast majority of the George Mason University Elementary PDS graduates are hired in FCPS, often times in their PDS site locations, which sometimes includes Title I schools. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="line-height:103%"><span verdana="">The period of this contract is 5 years.&nbsp; The total estimated payment to George Mason University for the 2019-2020 school year is approximately $170,000; Policy 5011 requires that the School Board approve &ldquo;any contract or contract amendment awarded between the School Board and other governmental entity that exceeds $250,000.&rdquo;&nbsp; Policy 5011.3 (III)(A)(1).</span></span></span></span></p>

Six School Board members (on a rotating basis) will each select an individual to serve a one-year term on the Interdepartmental Review Committee. For 2019-2020, the Board members making appointments are Megan McLaughlin (Braddock), Jane Strauss (Dranesville), Pat Hynes (Hunter Mill), Karen Corbett Sanders (Mount Vernon), Dalia Palchik (Providence), and Thomas Wilson (Sully). Last year the School Board district representatives from Lee, Mason, Springfield, and the three At-Large representatives were selected to appoint individuals. </span></span></span></span></p>

The level will be determined by a random selection. If the deliberations involve multiple levels, a randomly selected School Board appointee from each involved level will participate. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="background: white;">This document meets the requirements of the Virginia Department of Education, Standard 6 (&sect;22.1-253.13:6) in the Standards of Quality. All of the information provided in this plan was previously presented to the School Board during the past year in a variety of reports, including Strategic Plan goal reports. Standard 6 requires each local school board to adopt biennially a Divisionwide Comprehensive Plan. This updated divisionwide comprehensive plan is a revision of the plan adopted by the Fairfax County School Board in October 2017.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="background: white;">The purpose of the divisionwide comprehensive plan is to provide a platform for communicating major divisionwide initiatives and operational plans. The plan consists of School Board student success measures along with operational plans for the system. </span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="background: white;">The plan will be presented for public comment on October 10, 2019. The Board is scheduled to approve the plan at its October 24, 2019 meeting.</span></span></span></p>
