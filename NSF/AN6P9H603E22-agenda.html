<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">In an effort to promote awareness of school bullying, the Virginia School Board Association Board of Directors has designated the month of October as VSBA Bullying Prevention Month. Childhood bullying is a significant problem nationwide. It can cause school absenteeism, mental and physical stress, poor school performance, poor self-esteem, and in some cases, school violence. Statistics show that 160,000 children in the United States miss school each day as a result of being bullied. School board members, superintendents, teachers, and parents play a critical role in creating a climate where bullying is not tolerated. It has been proven when adults and children stand together, bullying ends.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Fire Prevention Week 2017 focuses on the fact that in a fire, second count.&nbsp; The official theme, &quot;Every second counts; Plan 2 ways out&quot;, reinforces why everyone needs to have an escape plan.&nbsp; Seconds can mean the difference between residents of our community escaping safely from a fire or having their lives end in tragedy. </span></span><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">During Fire Prevention Week, October 8 - 14, fire safety educators around the country will work with citizens to teach them about fire safety tips, encourage them to draw a map of their home marking two exits from each room and a path to the outside from each exit, practice a home fire drill twice a year, regularly test their smoke alarms and provide activities featuring Sparky the Fire Dog.&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;">The National Alliance on Mental Illness or NAMI and participants across the country are raising awareness of mental illness during Mental Illness Awareness Week which is October 1-7.&nbsp; Each year NAMI works to fight stigma, provide support, educate the public and advocate for equal care.&nbsp; <span style="font-family: verdana,sans-serif;">NAMI</span><span style="font-family: verdana,sans-serif;"> believes that mental illness issues are important to address year round, but highlighting these issues during Mental Health Awareness Week provides a time for people to come together and display the passion and strength of those working to improve the lives of the tens of millions of Americans affected by mental illness.&nbsp;This year&rsquo;s theme is I am stigma free. Being Stigma Free means learning about and educating others on mental illness, focusing on connecting with people to see each other as individuals and not a diagnosis, and most importantly, taking action on mental health issues.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<div class="itembody"><p>Congratulations to the Oakton Girls Tennis Team for their success in winning their Conference, Region, and 6A State Championships!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Oakton girl&rsquo;s tennis team went undefeated in the Concorde Conference in the regular season with a 10-0 record.&nbsp; Of the 88 matches that the girls played, they won an astounding 85 of them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The girls went on to win the quarterfinal regionals, the semis, and then to move on to the finals.&nbsp; The key to the finals win, and a highlight of their season, was when Oakton&rsquo;s number one doubles team defeated the State Region Doubles winners which meant Oakton won 5-4 for the Virginia 6A Regional Title.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oakton went on to win the State title and to have an overall season record of 15-0.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most of the top six players were named All-Conference and All-Region 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> or Honorable Mention.</p>

This was the first tennis team championship for Marshall High School and only the 5<sup>th</sup> state team championship in the school&rsquo;s 50+ year history.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Under the guidance of 1<sup>st</sup> year head coach Arlene Fitz-Patrick, the team completed an undefeated season winning the Conference 13 championship. Their dominance continued throughout the regional and state semi-final matches without a loss. Entering the state-championship, the team faced undefeated Deep Run High School, the reigning state champion. After an epic 6 hour battle, Marshall&rsquo;s team defeated Deep Run 5-3 to complete a perfect season.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The team and their coach had a special relationship and a bond that strengthened throughout the season. While the team battled tough opponents, their new coach battled through cancer treatments and the loss of her home to a fire. The challenges only made them stronger and together they prevailed in completing an 18-0 season with 13 shutouts. Their inspirational story was covered in the Washington Post this past spring.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please join me in congratulating the team, their coach, and the administration on this outstanding accomplishment.</p>

<div class="itembody"><p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">The Fairfax County School Board would like to congratulate the outstanding accomplishments of the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Boys Varsity Tennis Team. For the fifth consecutive year, the Boys Varsity Team won the VHSL 5A State Championship! Heading into the 2017 season, the team knew it would be a rebuilding year having graduated five of their top six players and bidding farewell to Coach John Meyers as he retired. But, when early injuries sidelined two strong players, the prospect of another championship dimmed.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Undaunted, the team stepped up and relied on all 20 players to dominate conference play &ndash; losing only one match. In both the regional and state finals, TJ competed against strong contender Stone Bridge High School from Newport News. Although Stone Bridge switched their line up to try to gain a tactical advantage, the Colonials prevailed in a 5-2 win to take the title.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">We&rsquo;d like to congratulate TJ&rsquo;s Colonial&rsquo;s Coaches: Jay Wickliff, Rick Whittenberger, Adam Wong and the Colonial Boys Varsity Tennis Team for their victory.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Subject</strong>:&nbsp; <span calibri="">Strategic Plan Goal 4: Resource Stewardship</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>School Board Action Required</strong>:&nbsp; Action</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="color: black;">In July 2015, the School Board approved <strong>Ignite, </strong>the strategic plan for Fairfax County Public Schools, which represents the cooperative work of the School Board and Leadership Team, with significant community input, to create a long term plan for continuous improvement. At the core of this plan is the FCPS <em>Portrait of a Graduate</em>. The Ignite Plan contains four strategic goals: Student Success, Caring Culture, Premier Workforce, and Resource Stewardship. </span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="color: black;">The School Board is to receive quarterly updates/reports on the Strategic Plan, focused on the work accomplished and the results received. In addition, the report will outline major Strategic Plan activities for the coming year that are designed to address areas in need of improvement. This presentation and report will provide an update on the monitoring metrics and current work that support Goal 4, Resource Stewardship.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="color: black;">The following are the two overarching strategies and the desired outcomes for Goal 4, Resource Stewardship:</span></span></span></p>

	<li><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="color: black;">Benchmarking processes will weigh major organizational operations against comparable school systems for effectiveness, efficiency, and Return on Investment</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong><span style="color: black;">Overarching Strategy 11</span></strong></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="color: black;">Promote the value and benefits of the community&rsquo;s investment in FCPS in order to increase the community&rsquo;s understanding of the Division&rsquo;s operating and capital needs to support student success</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="color: black;">Stakeholders will understand where and how financial resources will be utilized</span></span></span></li>

</ul>

<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><u><span style="color: windowtext;">FCPS Conditions to the Purchasing Resolution</span></u><span style="color: windowtext;">:</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:15.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:15.0pt;"><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="color: windowtext;">As was done in connection with the School Board&rsquo;s adoption of the 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 Purchasing Resolutions, school system staff recommends that the School Board adopt the 2017 Purchasing Resolution, subject to the following two conditions:</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:15.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The &ldquo;FCPS Construction Exception,&rdquo; which is set forth in Article 1, Section 3(A)(2.) and Article 3, Section 1(2.) of the Purchasing Resolution and which is by definition an exception to the Purchasing Resolution, shall be revised to read as follows:</span></li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:67.5pt;"><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="color: windowtext;">&ldquo;The Fairfax County School Board shall be responsible for construction, related architectural and engineering services, related consulting services, maintenance, repair, and related services in connection with building, furnishing, equipping, renovating, maintaining, and operating the buildings and property of the school division in accordance with &sect;22.1-79 of the Code of Virginia. The Fairfax County School Board&rsquo;s procurement, award, and execution of contracts under this provision shall be in accordance with the policies and regulations of the school division and with the Code of Virginia, including the VPPA.&rdquo;&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:60.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:67.5pt;"><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><em><span style="color: windowtext;">[Note:&nbsp; The following text is presently contained in the above-referenced Articles of the Purchasing Resolution adopted by the BOS, but this text would be excluded from the School Board&rsquo;s adoption because it inaccurately describes the Superintendent&rsquo;s authority:&nbsp; &ldquo;The school division&rsquo;s Superintendent or his designee shall have the same authority as the County Purchasing Agent to execute and administer contracts.&nbsp; Execution of contracts under this section shall be conducted under the rules and regulations established by the Fairfax County School Board in accordance with the mandatory sections in the Code of Virginia.&rdquo;]</span></em></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The Fairfax County School Board reserves the right to procure and award contracts for goods, services, and insurance pursuant to its own policies and regulations and pursuant to the Code of Virginia, including the VPPA, where such is in the best interest of the school division.</span></li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:-.25pt;"><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Recommendation: </strong></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">That the School Board adopts the newly revised 2017 Fairfax County Purchasing Resolution, previously adopted by the Board of Supervisors, subject to the conditions detailed in the agenda item.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>School Board Action Required: </strong>Decision &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Key Points:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="color: black;">The current version of Regulation 3009, Challenged Library and Instructional Materials, establishes an Interdepartmental Review Committee to review challenges of library and instructional materials by residents.&nbsp;Six School Board members (on a rotating basis) will each select an individual to serve a one-year term on the Interdepartmental Review Committee.&nbsp; For 2017-2018 the Board members making appointments are&nbsp;Megan McLaughlin (Braddock), Jane Strauss (Dranesville), Pat Hynes (Hunter Mill), Karen Corbett Sanders (Mount Vernon), Dalia Palchik (Providence), and Thomas Wilson (Sully). Last year the School Board district representatives were from Lee, Springfield, Mason, and three Members-at-Large were selected&nbsp;to appoint individuals. </span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="color: black;">Two appointees will participate at each of the three levels of challenged materials: elementary, middle, and high school.&nbsp; The level will be determined by a random selection.&nbsp; If the deliberations involve multiple levels, a randomly selected School Board appointee from each involved level will participate.&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="color: black;">The student representative to the School Board appoints an individual to serve on the Interdepartmental Review Committee for challenges that involve high school materials.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="color: black;">Other committee members are appointed to serve one-year terms as set forth in the current version of Regulation 3009.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Recommendation:</strong></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">That the School Board appoint individuals to serve a one-year term on the Challenged Materials Interdepartmental Review Committee, as detailed in the agenda item.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
