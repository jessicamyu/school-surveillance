<div class="itembody"><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;">Dear North Mecklenburg CMS families,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-size:14px;">We invite you to join members of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education for a&nbsp;discussion of the implications and impact of HB514. As you may know, HB514 is an&nbsp;NCGA legislative proposal to create municipal charter schools funded by local taxing&nbsp;authority.&nbsp;We want to hear directly from you &ndash; your thoughts on HB514, on the CMS schools that&nbsp;serve you and any concerns you have about your public schools.&nbsp;It is important that you be able to ask questions, learn more and understand the&nbsp;possible impacts of HB514 for you, your students, our community and public education&nbsp;in North Carolina. We believe that HB514 is not in the best interests of the students&nbsp;and families in Mecklenburg County.&nbsp;</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;">Please join us on Tuesday, May 15, at Huntersville Elementary School, located at 200&nbsp;Gilead Road, Huntersville NC 28078, for a town hall meeting to discuss HB514. The&nbsp;meeting will begin at 7 p.m. and last until 8:30 p.m. No RSVP is necessary and&nbsp;informational materials will be provided.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-size:14px;">We are committed to serving families and students in North Mecklenburg by providing&nbsp;the best schools possible.&nbsp;We value your input and look forward to hearing your opinions and concerns.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-size:14px;">Sincerely,<br />
Mary McCray<br />
Chair, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education</span></p>
