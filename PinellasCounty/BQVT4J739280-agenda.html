<div class="itembody"><div><u>BACKGROUND</u>:</div>

<div>
<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In alignment with the state of Florida, Pinellas County Schools proudly supports Gifted and Talented Awareness Week during the week of November 1-7, 2020. This is a time to celebrate our district&rsquo;s continued commitment to dynamic gifted education, to reflect on how we identify gifted students to provide all with opportunities for an equitable education&nbsp;and to recognize the continued impact that gifted and talented education has had in our community. While gifted and talented teachers are well versed in gifted and talented education, additional exposure by other stakeholders is needed to build better community understanding of gifted and talented students, the program&rsquo;s primary goals and student&nbsp;progress.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Throughout Gifted and Talented Awareness Week, resources are provided to schools, teachers and district staff for use&nbsp;in support of the National Association of Gifted Children&rsquo;s Campaign called &ldquo;Giftedness Knows No Boundaries&rdquo; which recognizes four goals in the identification and support of gifted children:</span></span></p>

	<li class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong><span style="background:white"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-weight:normal">Teach Me</span></span></span></strong><b><span style="background:white"><span style="color:black">-</span></span></b><span style="background:white"><span style="color:black"> Gifted and talented children have unique learning needs that set them apart from their peers and benefit most when they are taught by teachers trained to support them. </span></span></span></span></li>

</ol>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="line-height:107%">Resources to support these goals include digital posters for each goal of the campaign&nbsp;and a flyer showing how Pinellas County Schools is currently addressing each of these goals as a district. Schools are encouraged to personalize the&nbsp;resources by adding in student anecdotes, program highlights and teacher spotlights to promote awareness on their school&rsquo;s website and social media accounts. </span></span></span></p>

<div class="rightcol">Approve the proclamation recognizing Lights on Afterschool on October 22, 2020.</div>
<div class="itembody"><div><u>BACKGROUND</u>:</div>

<div>
<p>Launched in October 2000, Lights On Afterschool is a nationwide event celebrating afterschool programs and their important role in the lives of children, families and communities.&nbsp;Quality afterschool programs help children and youth discover their talents and passions while providing an opportunity to learn in a different kind of environment than they experience during the regular school day.&nbsp;These programs are essential to helping kids succeed and give working parents the peace of mind that comes with knowing their children are safe and supervised with opportunities to learn.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On October 22, 2020, which marks the 21st annual Lights on Afterschool, more than 8,000 local and national events are scheduled to send a powerful message that millions more kids need quality afterschool programs.&nbsp;Many afterschool programs are facing funding shortfalls so severe that they are being forced to close their doors and turn off their lights.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pinellas County Schools&rsquo; afterschool programs support students by offering tutoring, academic support and enrichment activities before and after the school day.&nbsp;In addition to Summer Bridge programs, 21st Century programs, and STEM Clubs, the district partners with the Juvenile Welfare Board of Pinellas to support the Promise Time program, a collaborative initiative that pools the resources of the district and the community to provide extended learning at many of our elementary school sites.&nbsp;Today is a perfect opportunity to recognize and thank our contributing partners</p>

</div>
<div class="itembody"><div><u>BACKGROUND</u>:
<p>The University of South Florida, a public university whose mission is to partner with the community to serve the people of the state of Florida and others, recently announced their intention to close&nbsp;its undergraduate teacher preparation programs.&nbsp;This action was taken without collaboration with local stakeholders, including Pinellas County Schools. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We depend heavily upon the USF undergraduate teacher preparation programs to fill our teacher vacancies, and its absence will directly and negatively impact&nbsp;our district, as well as&nbsp;the educational and economic health and quality of life for the entire Tampa Bay region, with&nbsp;more than&nbsp;50,000 teaching positions in our area.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We request the board adopt the resolution supporting any and all efforts to maintain USF&rsquo;s College of Education undergraduate teacher preparation programs at all of its campuses, and encourage USF to work closely with Pinellas County Schools and other stakeholders and partners to find alternatives to the closure of these programs that will further its stated public mission to partner with the Tampa Bay region to serve the people of the state of Florida.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Board welcomes public comment. For those who wish to speak to the Board, please note the following:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">You are given three separate opportunities to speak. The first is during &quot;Public Comment&quot; on a topic not included in the agenda but pertaining to the general business of the district, and this opportunity occurs after adjournment of regular meetings. The second is on one or more agenda items upon which the Board will vote, and this opportunity occurs after the special order agenda at regular meetings and as appropriate at special meetings. The third is at public hearings, such as budget hearings, and second readings on Board policy, when you are able to speak to the Board before it takes action.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In each case, (1) you must register to speak with the Superintendent&rsquo;s designee at the entrance to the meeting room as described below; (2) you will be called in the order you registered with the Superintendent&#39;s designee; (3) you will be allotted three (3) minutes, which may only be extended with the approval of the chairperson; and (4) you may not yield your time to any other person. To avoid repetition, speakers supporting or opposing the same issue are encouraged to designate a spokesperson and have the spokesperson request that members of the audience supporting the position stand during the presentation.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If you wish to speak to agenda items, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker on agenda items concludes his or her comments whichever is later. If you wish to speak during the Public Comment period, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker concludes his or her comments, whichever is later. If you wish to speak during a Public Hearing, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker during the Public Hearing concludes his or her comments, whichever is later.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The following additional procedures apply depending upon the specific speaking opportunity:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Public Comment. The Board will hear public comment on the general business of the district after adjournment of regular meetings. The Board will not act on any matter you may raise during your presentation.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Numbered Agenda Items. Time will be set aside immediately following the special order agenda at regular meetings and as appropriate at special meetings for you to address numbered agenda items upon which the Board will vote. You may address as many agenda items as you wish during your three (3) minute period, other than items pertaining to employee or student discipline, or any other matter listed in Section 286.0114(3), F.S., such as ministerial acts or emergencies.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Public Hearings. Time will be set aside at each public hearing for you to speak on the agenda item. You must confine your comments to the agenda item.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Regulation of Disruptive Speech<br />
Board meetings are a limited open forum for First Amendment purposes, and your exercise of your First Amendment right of free speech in that context will be recognized and protected, subject to reasonable restrictions as to time, place, and manner.

To ensure the expeditious and orderly process of Board meetings, the Chairperson may:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Interrupt or terminate a speaker when his/her statement is not relevant, exceeds the time allotted, or is abusive, threatening, defamatory, obscene, profane, loud, interruptive, or otherwise of a disruptive or disorderly nature; and</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Order the removal of any person interfering with the expeditious or orderly process of the meeting, provided the Chairperson has first issued a warning that continued interference with the orderly processes of the meeting will result in removal.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Nothing herein is intended, nor shall anything be construed, to limit or restrain negative, positive, or neutral comments about the manner in which Board employees, agents, the Superintendent, and Board members carry out their duties in public employment or office.</span></span></p>

<p><br />

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="line-height:normal"><u><span style="color:#323232">BACKGROUND</span></u><span style="color:#323232">:</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="color:#323232">District personnel and the YMCA of Greater St. Petersburg (YMCA) began discussions in November 2015 focused on the concept of building and operating a shared use facility on the property which was once Riviera Middle School. The shared use facility would house a middle school built and operated by the district as well as a fully functioning YMCA built for and operated by the YMCA. The facility would also house shared spaces that both parties could use exclusively and during mutual use times.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="color:#323232">On September 12, 2017, the Board approved a Joint Development Agreement (JDA) with the YMCA to define and initiate the process of planning and building the school, the YMCA, and the shared use spaces. The JDA provided a general framework as to how the facilities would be used by both the Board and the YMCA and provided a framework to guide both parties through the design and construction phases of the project, including the financial responsibilities associated with the design and construction of the facilities for each party. The JDA also stated that both parties would enter into a &ldquo;separate agreement under mutually agreeable terms setting out more specifically the parameters for the use of each parties&#39; facilities&rdquo;. This Shared Use and Management Agreement is that separate agreement.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="color:#323232">This request also includes the Ground Lease Agreement which defines the area of the property to be leased to the YMCA for the construction and ongoing operation of the YMCA facilities and shared facilities.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="color:#323232">This is the final step in the process of defining and securing mutual understandings and agreements between the district and the YMCA and allows for the parties to initiate the construction process.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="line-height:normal"><u>BACKGROUND</u>:</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="line-height:normal">A calendar committee representing parents, teachers, support staff, instructional staff, and various community groups met on two occasions to develop the Instructional Calendar for the 2021-2022 school year. The proposed calendar includes the following:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li>A school start date for 10-month instructional staff on Monday, August 2, 2021, and for students on Wednesday, August 11, 2021</li>
	<li>Eighty-six (86) days of instruction during the first semester and ninety-four (94) days second semester, providing for the administration of first semester exams prior to winter break</li>
	<li>Seven days of preplanning for 10-month teachers</li>
	<li>Potential hurricane make-up days on October 8, 2021, January 3, 2022, and March 21, 2022. If four (4) hurricane make-up days are needed those will be held on October 8, 2021, November 22, 2021, November 23, 2021 and January 3, 2022.</li>
	<li>A Thanksgiving break from Saturday, November 20, 2021, through Sunday, November 28, 2021, for students and 10-month instructional staff</li>
	<li>A winter break commencing Saturday, December 18, 2021, with 10-month instructional staff returning on Monday, January 3, 2022, and students returning on Tuesday, January 4, 2022</li>
	<li>A spring break from Saturday, March 12, 2021, through Sunday, March 20, 2021, for students and 10-month instructional staff</li>
	<li style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="line-height:normal">A school ending date for students on Thursday, May 26, 2022, and for 10-month instructional staff on Friday, May 27, 2022</span></li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="line-height:normal"><u>RATIONALE</u>:</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="line-height:normal">The proposed Instructional Calendar is recommended based on input from representatives of a multitude of stakeholder groups. The calendar takes into consideration a number of non-negotiables:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="line-height:normal">That the Pinellas County School District makes all decisions based on what is in the best interest of students.</span></li>
	<li style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="line-height:normal">A legislative mandate that the opening date for schools may not be earlier than August 10 of each year.</span></li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="line-height:normal">This year’s calendar committee also considered input from multiple stakeholder groups, including parents, who have requested that the district continues to provide a schedule that permits the administration of first semester exams prior to winter break.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Board welcomes public comment. For those who wish to speak to the Board, please note the following:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">You are given three separate opportunities to speak. The first is during &quot;Public Comment&quot; on a topic not included in the agenda but pertaining to the general business of the district, and this opportunity occurs after adjournment of regular meetings. The second is on one or more agenda items upon which the Board will vote, and this opportunity occurs after the special order agenda at regular meetings and as appropriate at special meetings. The third is at public hearings, such as budget hearings, and second readings on Board policy, when you are able to speak to the Board before it takes action.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In each case, (1) you must register to speak with the Superintendent&rsquo;s designee at the entrance to the meeting room as described below; (2) you will be called in the order you registered with the Superintendent&#39;s designee; (3) you will be allotted three (3) minutes, which may only be extended with the approval of the chairperson; and (4) you may not yield your time to any other person. To avoid repetition, speakers supporting or opposing the same issue are encouraged to designate a spokesperson and have the spokesperson request that members of the audience supporting the position stand during the presentation.</span></span></p>
