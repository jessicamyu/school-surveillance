</div>
<div class="itembody"><div><u>BACKGROUND</u>:</div>

<div>
<p>November is designated as Family Engagement in Education Month, a time to celebrate the vital role parents and families play in their children&#39;s education. When schools and families work together to support learning, students are more motivated to succeed-not just in school, but throughout life.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pandemic has placed a laser-focus on the importance of families&nbsp;in student learning. The American Rescue Plan offers a variety of opportunities for the district to expand family engagement strategies and practices to make them more equitable for the long term. Pinellas County Schools is committed to partnering with families for the successful academic, social and emotional development of children through education, empowerment and support. The Office of Strategic Partnerships has worked diligently to facilitate a new way of work by establishing a district Family Engagement Team, with representatives from many district departments, to guide and facilitate family engagement across the district.&nbsp; The district team is focusing on a pilot program with our Reading Recovery students and their families, to both support these 1st grade students to meet and maintain grade-level expectations in literacy and, at the same time, gain valuable information about how to successfully implement family-school partnerships as an instructional strategy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, schools across Pinellas County have developed Family Engagement Action Teams to encourage and maximize family engagement opportunities. These opportunities, provided in a variety of formats, include face-to-face workshops, webinars, social media, home visits and videos on key topics. At each interaction, parents learn and practice new skills and strategies to support learning at home, while also sharing and incorporating knowledge about their child. Furthermore, the Office of Strategic Partnerships provides training to school leaders, teachers, support staff and parents on effective strategies to foster positive communication and authentic collaboration between families and school to increase student achievement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Family Engagement in Education Month is a time to celebrate the accomplishments of our successful family and school partnerships, which are built and sustained throughout the year.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Board welcomes public comment. For those who wish to speak to the Board, please note the following:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">You are given three separate opportunities to speak. The first is during &quot;Public Comment&quot; on a topic not included in the agenda but pertaining to the general business of the district, and this opportunity occurs after adjournment of regular meetings. The second is on one or more agenda items upon which the Board will vote, and this opportunity occurs after the special order agenda at regular meetings and as appropriate at special meetings. The third is at public hearings, such as budget hearings, and second readings on Board policy, when you are able to speak to the Board before it takes action.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In each case, (1) you must register to speak with the Superintendent&rsquo;s designee at the entrance to the meeting room as described below; (2) you will be called in the order you registered with the Superintendent&#39;s designee; (3) you will be allotted three (3) minutes, which may only be extended with the approval of the chairperson; and (4) you may not yield your time to any other person. To avoid repetition, speakers supporting or opposing the same issue are encouraged to designate a spokesperson and have the spokesperson request that members of the audience supporting the position stand during the presentation.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If you wish to speak to agenda items, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker on agenda items concludes his or her comments whichever is later. If you wish to speak during the Public Comment period, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker concludes his or her comments, whichever is later. If you wish to speak during a Public Hearing, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker during the Public Hearing concludes his or her comments, whichever is later.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The following additional procedures apply depending upon the specific speaking opportunity:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Public Comment. The Board will hear public comment on the general business of the district after adjournment of regular meetings. The Board will not act on any matter you may raise during your presentation.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Numbered Agenda Items. Time will be set aside immediately following the special order agenda at regular meetings and as appropriate at special meetings for you to address numbered agenda items upon which the Board will vote. You may address as many agenda items as you wish during your three (3) minute period, other than items pertaining to employee or student discipline, or any other matter listed in Section 286.0114(3), F.S., such as ministerial acts or emergencies.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Public Hearings. Time will be set aside at each public hearing for you to speak on the agenda item. You must confine your comments to the agenda item.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Regulation of Disruptive Speech<br />
Board meetings are a limited open forum for First Amendment purposes, and your exercise of your First Amendment right of free speech in that context will be recognized and protected, subject to reasonable restrictions as to time, place, and manner. Applause is permitted only when awards are granted.<br />
To ensure the expeditious and orderly process of Board meetings, the Chairperson may:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Interrupt or terminate a speaker when his/her statement is not relevant, exceeds the time allotted, or is abusive, threatening, defamatory, obscene, profane, loud, interruptive, or otherwise of a disruptive or disorderly nature; and</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Order the removal of any person interfering with the expeditious or orderly process of the meeting, provided the Chairperson has first issued a warning that continued interference with the orderly processes of the meeting will result in removal.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Nothing herein is intended, nor shall anything be construed, to limit or restrain negative, positive, or neutral comments about the manner in which Board employees, agents, the Superintendent, and Board members carry out their duties in public employment or office.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Recording of Board Meetings<br />

</div>
<div class="itembody"><div><u>BACKGROUND</u>:
<p>The Schools Police Communications Center is located within the Pinellas County Schools Police command station and operates twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Staffing consists of seven&nbsp;dispatchers and one&nbsp;supervisor; all of whom are certified 911 Public Safety Telecommunicators.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Schools Police Communications Center is in direct connection with Schools Police Officers;&nbsp;Pinellas County Sheriff&#39;s Deputies;&nbsp;police officers from St. Petersburg, Gulfport, Pinellas Park, Largo, Clearwater and Tarpon Springs;&nbsp;and each of our school facilities in both emergency and non-emergency situations. In addition, they are responsible for the continual monitoring of all district security cameras, tracking of the Global Positioning System (GPS) on Schools Police vehicles and school buses, card access control&nbsp;and intrusion, active assailant&nbsp;and fire alarms.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The communications center is also responsible for the testing of various alarms, monitoring classroom intercom button activations;&nbsp;making weather notifications;&nbsp;processing and coordinating FortifyFL and&nbsp;Sandy Hook See Something, Say Something&nbsp;anonymous reporting apps;&nbsp;and coordinating and responding to mobile activations of the &ldquo;Alyssa&rsquo;s Alert&rdquo; SaferWatch app.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The communications center currently has one command console to control and monitor all of these functions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Motorola Solutions operates under Florida State Contract No.# 43190000-18-NASPO-ACS-1 and is the sole provider of the proposed equipment needed to upgrade the communications center. The Pinellas County Sheriff&#39;s Office, the Pinellas County 911 System and the St. Petersburg Police Department utilizes this equipment for countywide compatibility.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Motorola Solutions will:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Upgrade the existing radio console hardware in the amount $15,310</li>
	<li>Install, configure&nbsp;and connect two radio consoles in the&nbsp;amount $164,297.34</li>
	<li>Install an&nbsp;antenna between the county&rsquo;s Public Safety Complex site (911 Center) and the Pinellas County Schools Police dispatch center in the amount $9,252</li>
	<li>Provide labor services for the two radio consoles in the amount $119,688; the existing radio console in the amount&nbsp;$4,400; and an&nbsp;antenna in the amount $83,330</li>
	<li>Confirm the functionality and performance of installed equipment in addition to training staff</li>
</ul>

<p>Pinellas County Schools maintenance department will:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Demolish the existing communications center and install new electrical wiring in the amount of $50,000</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div><u>RATIONALE</u>:</div>

<div>
<p>The Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act and other requirements as enacted by the legislature and the Office of Safe Schools have necessitated the expansion of our communications center to better and more efficiently accomplish the tasks required of the Schools Police dispatchers. The Schools Police communications center is currently equipped with a single Motorola dispatch radio console which allows a single dispatcher to communicate, dispatch&nbsp;and coordinate personnel and resources to various situations. Three dispatchers are on duty in the communications center during the school day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The addition of the two new radio dispatch consoles and the necessary space modifications will allow for more efficiency and decrease the likelihood for errors while increasing the ability to maintain safety and allow students to learn in a safe learning environment. These upgrades will allow each dispatcher&nbsp;to have his/her own console.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the case of an emergency, the new communications center equipment and configuration will allow for a dispatcher&nbsp;to handle the emergency while the other dispatchers can handle other tasks and address other needs of the district or a second emergency if one were to present itself.</p>

<div class="itembody"><div><u>BACKGROUND</u>:</div>

<div>
<div>
<p><span style="font-size:11px;">In 1972 the&nbsp;board entered into a 25-year&nbsp;Joint Land Utilization Agreement (Agreement) with the City of Clearwater (City) that permitted the City to construct and maintain community facilities on land owned by the School Board. The property is on the same site and adjacent to the former&nbsp;Curtis Fundamental&nbsp;School, Clearwater Intermediate School and the Martin Luther King Jr. Neighborhood&nbsp;Center, and is not located on the site of the North Greenwood African-American lost cemetery.&nbsp; The Agreement was renewed two previous times and expires on December 31, 2021. The City would like the continued use for the community and will continue to maintain the land and facilities. The Agreement is for a period of 10 years, beginning January 1, 2022, and ending December 31, 2031.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u>RATIONALE</u>:</div>

<div>
<p><span style="font-size:11px;">Approving the agreement provides the continuation of recreation facilities to the community that would otherwise not be available.&nbsp;This agreement has been beneficial to both agencies, and its renewal will continue to make available an expanded level of services to students and the public.</span></p>

<p><u>BACKGROUND</u>:</p>

<p class="CxSpFirst">The warehouse receives requests from schools and district sites to pick up surplus and obsolete property. A district property forum has been established for schools and district sites to post useful surplus items before being disposed of to provide an opportunity for other district sites to obtain this surplus property.

</div>
<div class="itembody"><div><u>BACKGROUND</u>:</div>

<div>
<p>Policy 8600 is being revised to align with district practices and improve the efficiency of departmental procedures. The following adjustments are being considered:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Updated the&nbsp;reimbursement of isolated transportation to reflect Superintendent approval when determined necessary under the three conditions identified in the policy.&nbsp;As noted within the Policy, the Superintendent is authorized to disburse funds for reimbursement to parents/guardians of students who are eligible for school bus transportation, but for whom bus transportation is not economically feasible due to isolation from the assigned school, and when said parents/guardians, through private means, provide transportation to an assigned school or bus stop. This change for Superintendent approval for reimbursement will allow for more timely reimbursement to&nbsp;parents/guardians.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Updated Policy to designate that the procedures, guidelines and principles for bus routing and procedures to&nbsp;incorporated into a new transportation routing procedures manual.</li>
	<li>Updated principles for crossing multi-lane roads for students in grades 6-12. The proposed&nbsp;changes allow grades 6-12 students to cross certain three lane roads only if defined pedestrian safety measures are in place.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div><u>RATIONALE</u>:</div>

<div>Proposed amendments are brought forward to allow for more effective and efficient response to parents/guardians regarding isolated transportation reimbursement, to ensure routing procedures are outlined and documented within a procedure manual&nbsp;and update principles to multi-lane crossing for students in secondary grade levels which mirrors statutory language defining hazardous road conditions and considers the efforts Pinellas County and local municipalities have made in recent years to improve pedestrian safety through the installation of various devices that make the crossing of roads safer for all pedestrians.</div>

<p><u>BACKGROUND</u>:</p>

<p>Since March 2020, the Family First Coronavirus Relief Act (FFCRA) provided paid time off for employees who were unable to work due to reasons related to COVID. This was extended to September 30, 2021, by the authority granted under the American Rescue Plan. The district and&nbsp;PCTA&nbsp;and PESPA bargaining teams recognized the need to ensure that employees who are required to quarantine due to COVID continue to be paid after this date, and agreed on specific terms and conditions for which employees could be paid. Vaccinated employees required to quarantine will be paid up to ten (10) days provided they have not already used ten (10) days of COVID sick leave since March 2020. Employees who are not eligible for this COVID sick leave may access the sick leave bank which allows for up to ten (10) days if required to quarantine. These agreements will be in effect until December 17, 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>RATIONALE</u>:</p>

<p>The respective bargaining teams worked collaboratively on these agreements and believe these agreements provide&nbsp;employees with the ability to get paid when they are required to quarantine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

The second is on one or more agenda items upon which the Board will vote, and this opportunity occurs after the special order agenda at regular meetings and as appropriate at special meetings. The third is at public hearings, such as budget hearings, and second readings on Board policy, when you are able to speak to the Board before it takes action.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If you wish to speak to agenda items, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker on agenda items concludes his or her comments whichever is later.
