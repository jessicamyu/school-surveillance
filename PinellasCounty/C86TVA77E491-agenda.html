<div class="itembody"><div><u>BACKGROUND</u>:&nbsp;
<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">First responders (police, fire and emergency medical responders) are dedicated to serving their communities and protecting all citizens. They are the first to run toward danger and shepherd all others to safety without thought of their own wellbeing. Each day the risks presented to this elite group grow increasingly more severe and all too numerous, yet they remain vigilant and ready to answer the call.&nbsp; Pinellas County Schools (PCS) recognizes the First Responder community and the many connections between PCS and First Responders.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Pinellas County Schools features a number of direct pathways to careers within the First Responder community.&nbsp; Pinellas Park High School has long established magnet programs that include criminal justice and firefighting.&nbsp; Several middle schools and high schools have introduction courses to first responder careers that serve as pathways to the magnet programs and dual enrollment at Pinellas Technical College (PTC).&nbsp; At PTC, career programs in emergency medical technician and firefighter apprenticeship are popular programs leading to direct employment.&nbsp; Additionally, internships within the first responder pathways exist in both high school and at the technical colleges.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Pinellas County Schools is dedicating the second week of January as a time to formally recognize and show appreciation for First Responders and the service that police, fire and emergency medical responders across Pinellas County and the state of Florida provide each and every day. During the week, teachers and students take the opportunity to recognize first responders in their school community and thank them for all they do. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Their service sets a great example to our students and, through this presentation, the district recognizes all Pinellas County First Responders.</span></span></p>

</div>
<div class="itembody"><div><u>BACKGROUND</u>:&nbsp;</div>

<div>January is National Mentoring Month. The Pinellas County Schools is grateful for all the mentors who returned to face-to-face mentoring, as well as the ones who continued to mentor virtually.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mentoring&nbsp;creates a transformational experience for so many of our students. Mentors help guide positive choices, develop critical thinkers, support academic achievement and enhance social emotional well-being. The National Mentoring Month public awareness campaign is led by the National Mentoring Partnership, the Corporation for National and Community Service, the Harvard School of Public Health, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention and United Way Worldwide.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Research on formal mentoring programs&nbsp;indicates that students who are mentored are&nbsp;less likely to skip, more likely to be enrolled in college, increase their attendance, perform better academically, graduate from high school&nbsp;and are less likely to use drugs and/or alcohol. Currently, there are over 2,500 students who are mentored in Pinellas County Schools.&nbsp; This year we have also incorporated&nbsp;quarterly meetings in which the parent can attend a student session.&nbsp;As a spinoff, Career Conversations and Mentor Coffee Hour are virtual meetings that permit students to discuss careers with keynote speakers and allow mentors to engage and network with each other, share their experiences&nbsp;and discuss best practices. The volunteer system and several mentoring programs have&nbsp;been recognized nationally for developing and implementing the district&#39;s virtual mentoring program.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>We are proud of district&#39;s mentoring programs that include general mentors and tutors, Lunch Pals, Take Stock in Children,&nbsp;5000 Role Models of Excellence, Girlfriends, St. Petersburg Promise, Big Brothers Big Sisters&nbsp;and Peer-to-Peer Mentoring.&nbsp; On October 21, 2021, Congresswoman Fredricka Wilson virtually attended the Campbell Park Elementary 5000 Role Model Induction Ceremony. She encouraged the male students to study hard and do great things in life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

You may address as many agenda items as you wish during your three (3) minute period, other than items pertaining to employee or student discipline, or any other matter listed in Section 286.0114(3), F.S., such as ministerial acts or emergencies.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Public Hearings. Time will be set aside at each public hearing for you to speak on the agenda item. You must confine your comments to the agenda item.</span></span></li>

</div>
<div class="itembody"><div>
<p><u>BACKGROUND</u>:</p>

<p>Policy 8600 is being revised to align with district practices and improve the efficiency of departmental procedures. The following amendments are being considered:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Revise&nbsp;the&nbsp;reimbursement of isolated transportation to reflect Superintendent approval when determined necessary under the three conditions identified in the policy.&nbsp;As noted within the Policy, the Superintendent is authorized to disburse funds for reimbursement to parents/guardians of students who are eligible for school bus transportation, but for whom bus transportation is not economically feasible due to isolation from the assigned school and when said parents/guardians, through private means, provide transportation to an assigned school or bus stop. This change for Superintendent approval for reimbursement will allow for more timely reimbursement to&nbsp;parents/guardians.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Designate procedures, guidelines and principles for bus routing and procedures to be incorporated into a new transportation routing procedures manual.</li>
	<li>Update&nbsp;principles for crossing multi-lane roads for students in grades 6-12. The proposed&nbsp;changes allow grades 6-12 students to cross certain three lane roads only if defined pedestrian safety measures are in place.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><u>RATIONALE</u>:</p>

<p>Proposed amendments allow for more effective and efficient response to parents/guardians regarding isolated transportation reimbursement, ensure routing procedures are outlined and documented within a procedure manual&nbsp;and mirrors statutory language defining hazardous road conditions and considers the efforts Pinellas County and local municipalities to improve pedestrian safety through the installation of various devices that make the crossing of roads safer for all pedestrians.</p>

<div>
<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt">Ms. Blossom continues to be aggressive with students and parents when completing her duties.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="line-height:normal"><u>RATIONALE</u>:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing">On February 2, 2021, Ms. Blossom was reprimanded for aggressive conduct towards community members while driving the school bus&nbsp;and was demoted from a bus driver to a bus assistant. On November 17, 2021, Ms. Blossom engaged in an argument with a student in front of other students. The bus was in motion and both parties were moving around the bus during the argument. When the bus arrived at the stop she lowered the window and began to yell at the student&#39;s mother that she did not raise her daughter properly.&nbsp; As the bus pulled away from the stop she again lowered the window and screamed at the mother.</p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="line-height:normal">The recommendation to dismiss Ms. Blossom&nbsp;is based on the fact that she violated Pinellas County School Board Policies 4140 A (13), &ldquo;Inappropriate or disparaging remarks to or about students or exposing a student to unnecessary embarrassment or disparagement,&rdquo; 4140 A (20), &ldquo;Insubordination, which is defined as a continuing or intentional failure to obey a direct order, reasonable in nature, and given by and with proper authority,&rdquo;</span>&nbsp;and 4140 A (22), &quot;Misconduct or Misconduct in office.&quot;</p>

<div>
<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt">Mr. Barron continues to use inappropriate methods of discipline when dealing with students.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="line-height:normal"><u>RATIONALE</u>:</span></p>

<p>On October 13, 2021, during sixth-grade lunch, Mr. Barron directed a student seated at a cafeteria table to stop causing a distraction by grabbing the belongings of other students and standing up without permission. The student refused to comply. In response, Mr. Barron grabbed the student by his arms, lifted him from his seat in order to get him to walk to the time out chair in the front area of the cafeteria. After they walked a few steps, Mr. Barron again lifted the student and carried him approximately ten (10) feet to the time out chair.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="line-height:normal">The recommendation to dismiss Mr. Barron is based on the fact that he violated Pinellas County School Board Policies 4140 A (7), &ldquo;Use of corporal punishment, excessive force or inappropriate method of discipline,&rdquo; 4140 A (9a), &quot;Failure to perform the duties of the position,&quot; 4140 A (13), &quot;Inappropriate or disparaging remarks to or about students or exposing a student to unnecessary embarrassment or disparagement,&quot; 4140 A (20), &ldquo;Insubordination, which is defined as a continuing or intentional failure to obey a direct order, reasonable in nature, and given by and with proper authority,&rdquo; and 4140 A (22), &quot;Misconduct or Misconduct in office.&quot;</span></p>

<div class="itembody"><div><u>BACKGROUND</u>:</div>

<div>Substitute teachers serve a critical role in Pinellas County Schools. When teachers are absent due to illnesses, professional development or other various reasons it is important that our schools have a qualified individual to serve as the students&#39; teacher during their absence. During the pandemic, the need for substitute teachers became increasingly evident. Our substitute pool provided necessary/critical coverage; however, the pool lessened.&nbsp; Based on this need, the district temporarily increased the daily rate of pay for substitutes.&nbsp; Once the rates were increased, the daily fill rates for teacher absences increased.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Substitute teachers are paid a daily rate, based partly on education credentials as well as the type of substitute position. The last time pay rates were adjusted for substitute teachers was in October 2017, when the daily rate was raised by $5 for all categories. The proposed permanent increase to the daily rate of pay for substitutes will be as follows:</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Board welcomes public comment. For those who wish to speak to the Board, please note the following:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">You are given three separate opportunities to speak. The first is during &quot;Public Comment&quot; on a topic not included in the agenda but pertaining to the general business of the district, and this opportunity occurs after adjournment of regular meetings. The second is on one or more agenda items upon which the Board will vote, and this opportunity occurs after the special order agenda at regular meetings and as appropriate at special meetings. The third is at public hearings, such as budget hearings, and second readings on Board policy, when you are able to speak to the Board before it takes action.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In each case, (1) you must register to speak with the Superintendent&rsquo;s designee at the entrance to the meeting room as described below; (2) you will be called in the order you registered with the Superintendent&#39;s designee; (3) you will be allotted three (3) minutes, which may only be extended with the approval of the chairperson; and (4) you may not yield your time to any other person. To avoid repetition, speakers supporting or opposing the same issue are encouraged to designate a spokesperson and have the spokesperson request that members of the audience supporting the position stand during the presentation.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If you wish to speak to agenda items, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker on agenda items concludes his or her comments whichever is later. If you wish to speak during the Public Comment period, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker concludes his or her comments, whichever is later. If you wish to speak during a Public Hearing, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker during the Public Hearing concludes his or her comments, whichever is later.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The following additional procedures apply depending upon the specific speaking opportunity:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Public Comment. The Board will hear public comment on the general business of the district after adjournment of regular meetings. The Board will not act on any matter you may raise during your presentation.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Numbered Agenda Items. Time will be set aside immediately following the special order agenda at regular meetings and as appropriate at special meetings for you to address numbered agenda items upon which the Board will vote. You may address as many agenda items as you wish during your three (3) minute period, other than items pertaining to employee or student discipline, or any other matter listed in Section 286.0114(3), F.S., such as ministerial acts or emergencies.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Public Hearings. Time will be set aside at each public hearing for you to speak on the agenda item. You must confine your comments to the agenda item.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Regulation of Disruptive Speech<br />
Board meetings are a limited open forum for First Amendment purposes, and your exercise of your First Amendment right of free speech in that context will be recognized and protected, subject to reasonable restrictions as to time, place, and manner. Applause is permitted only when awards are granted.<br />
To ensure the expeditious and orderly process of Board meetings, the Chairperson may:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Interrupt or terminate a speaker when his/her statement is not relevant, exceeds the time allotted, or is abusive, threatening, defamatory, obscene, profane, loud, interruptive, or otherwise of a disruptive or disorderly nature; and</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Order the removal of any person interfering with the expeditious or orderly process of the meeting, provided the Chairperson has first issued a warning that continued interference with the orderly processes of the meeting will result in removal.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Nothing herein is intended, nor shall anything be construed, to limit or restrain negative, positive, or neutral comments about the manner in which Board employees, agents, the Superintendent, and Board members carry out their duties in public employment or office.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Recording of Board Meetings<br />
Recordings are permitted under the following conditions:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">No obstructions are created between the Board and the audience.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">No interviews are conducted in the meeting room while the Board is in session.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">No commentary, adjustment of equipment, or positioning of operators is made that would distract either the Board or members of the audience while the Board is in session.</span></span></li>
</ol>
