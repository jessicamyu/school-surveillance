<div class="rightcol">Approve the proclamation designating May 12, 2021 as National School Nurse Day.</div>
<div class="itembody"><div><u>BACKGROUND</u>:</div>

<div>Since 1972, National School Nurse Day has been set aside to recognize school nurses. National School Nurse Day was established to foster a better understanding of the role of school nurses in the educational setting. This year, building on the increased visibility of nurses&#39; contributions, National Nurses&nbsp;Week&nbsp;has been expanded to Nurses Month in May.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>School nurses serve as a critical health hub for students, ensuring that students are ready for learning by managing complex, chronic conditions; identifying and addressing mental health issues; leveling the field on health disparities and promoting healthy behaviors; enrolling children in health insurance and connecting families to healthcare providers; handling medical emergencies; and now, navigating through the COVID-19 pandemic by testing, tracking&nbsp;and promoting vaccinations for students and school personnel. School nurses are essential for healthy kids, healthy schools&nbsp;and healthy communities.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="background:white"><span style="font-size:8.5pt"><span style="font-family:" verdana="">From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, school nurses have served as role models of healthy behaviors and recommended mitigation strategies.&nbsp; School nurses teach handwashing to students, model the proper wearing of face coverings&nbsp;and promote other behaviors to keep students at optimal health.&nbsp; This year has been particularly challenging, as school nurses have the front-line responsibility of assessing student illness and helping families navigate a safe return to school.&nbsp; Nurses have attended to students in the classrooms more than ever before to keep students in their cohort, allowing them the opportunity to establish better relationships with teachers.&nbsp; They assist school administrators with tracking positive cases among students and staff,&nbsp;monitoring return dates for students/staff in quarantine&nbsp;and helping families transition between learning environments.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>This year&#39;s theme is School Nurses: Championing the Whole Student.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="background:white"><span style="font-size:8.5pt"><span style="font-family:" verdana="">This theme recognizes the integral role that school nurses play bridging health and education to improve each child&rsquo;s cognitive, physical, social and emotional developmental, regardless of whether they are physically present in school or not.&nbsp; School nurses champion the whole student every day of the year, but National School Nurse Day is a special time to celebrate and recognize the valuable contributions that school nurses make to the health and learning of our students.</span></span></span></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Board welcomes public comment. For those who wish to speak to the Board, please note the following:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">You are given three separate opportunities to speak. The first is during &quot;Public Comment&quot; on a topic not included in the agenda but pertaining to the general business of the district, and this opportunity occurs after adjournment of regular meetings. The second is on one or more agenda items upon which the Board will vote, and this opportunity occurs after the special order agenda at regular meetings and as appropriate at special meetings. The third is at public hearings, such as budget hearings, and second readings on Board policy, when you are able to speak to the Board before it takes action.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In each case, (1) you must register to speak with the Superintendent&rsquo;s designee at the entrance to the meeting room as described below; (2) you will be called in the order you registered with the Superintendent&#39;s designee; (3) you will be allotted three (3) minutes, which may only be extended with the approval of the chairperson; and (4) you may not yield your time to any other person. To avoid repetition, speakers supporting or opposing the same issue are encouraged to designate a spokesperson and have the spokesperson request that members of the audience supporting the position stand during the presentation.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If you wish to speak to agenda items, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker on agenda items concludes his or her comments whichever is later. If you wish to speak during the Public Comment period, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker concludes his or her comments, whichever is later. If you wish to speak during a Public Hearing, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker during the Public Hearing concludes his or her comments, whichever is later.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The following additional procedures apply depending upon the specific speaking opportunity:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Public Comment. The Board will hear public comment on the general business of the district after adjournment of regular meetings. The Board will not act on any matter you may raise during your presentation.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Numbered Agenda Items. Time will be set aside immediately following the special order agenda at regular meetings and as appropriate at special meetings for you to address numbered agenda items upon which the Board will vote. You may address as many agenda items as you wish during your three (3) minute period, other than items pertaining to employee or student discipline, or any other matter listed in Section 286.0114(3), F.S., such as ministerial acts or emergencies.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Public Hearings. Time will be set aside at each public hearing for you to speak on the agenda item. You must confine your comments to the agenda item.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Regulation of Disruptive Speech<br />
Board meetings are a limited open forum for First Amendment purposes, and your exercise of your First Amendment right of free speech in that context will be recognized and protected, subject to reasonable restrictions as to time, place, and manner. Applause is permitted only when awards are granted.<br />
To ensure the expeditious and orderly process of Board meetings, the Chairperson may:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Interrupt or terminate a speaker when his/her statement is not relevant, exceeds the time allotted, or is abusive, threatening, defamatory, obscene, profane, loud, interruptive, or otherwise of a disruptive or disorderly nature; and</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Order the removal of any person interfering with the expeditious or orderly process of the meeting, provided the Chairperson has first issued a warning that continued interference with the orderly processes of the meeting will result in removal.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Nothing herein is intended, nor shall anything be construed, to limit or restrain negative, positive, or neutral comments about the manner in which Board employees, agents, the Superintendent, and Board members carry out their duties in public employment or office.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Recording of Board Meetings<br />
Recordings are permitted under the following conditions:</span></span></p>

<div class="itembody"><div><u>BACKGROUND</u>:&nbsp;</div>

<div>Pinellas County Schools is required to carry student accident insurance coverage,&nbsp;which meets the requirements of the Florida High School Athletic Association (FHSAA).&nbsp; This insurance is required for all&nbsp;students participating in high school athletics, as well as middle school sports and specific high-risk extracurricular activities.&nbsp; Parents are required to purchase this coverage for a nominal fee&nbsp;if their student participates in the designated sports and activities.&nbsp; Plans are also available on a voluntary basis to all students, regardless if they participate in athletics.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The student accident insurance covers out-of-pocket costs, not covered through the parent&#39;s primary insurance, such as deductibles, co-pays, and coinsurance, up to $25,000.&nbsp; There are currently 9,600 students enrolled in the plan for the 2020-2021 school year.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>In March 2021, Risk Management and Insurance evaluated&nbsp;proposals from three of the major providers of student accident insurance plans for school districts in Florida.&nbsp; Proposals were received from HSR, Inc., our current plan administrator,&nbsp;School Insurance of Florida&nbsp;and Fowinkle School Insurance.&nbsp; HSR, Inc. provided the lowest overall pricing for our current plan design and is the recommendation for our provider of student accident insurance.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>HSR is one of the nations&#39; leading Sports and Specialty Risk Insurance administrators.&nbsp;They provide plans to over 400 public school districts and charter schools. HSR has administered our student accident insurance plan since 2008 and the current agreement ends June 30, 2021. Their company provides a local agent to service Pinellas County Schools, with a positive history of service and claims payment.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>In addition, HSR provided a separate quote for the district&#39;s catastrophic student accident insurance coverage, also required by FHSAA.&nbsp;&nbsp;This policy, underwritten by Mutual of Omaha, has an aggregate&nbsp;benefit limit up to $1,000,000 per year.&nbsp;The cost of the catastrophic insurance policy is covered by the district and&nbsp;provides benefits after&nbsp;the parent&#39;s primary health insurance coverage is processed and after the student&#39;s individual student accident insurance limits have been met ($25,000).&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>
<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><u><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">RATIONALE</font></font></u><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">:&nbsp;</font></font></p>

<p>The student accident insurance benefit plan from HSR,&nbsp;paid for by parents,&nbsp;represents a 16% premium reduction from current rates. HSR also provides $5,000 in scholarship funds for student-athletes, who have a financial hardship and must have the coverage to participate in FHSAA-sanctioned sports.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The catastrophic insurance proposal from HSR is $18,398 per year, guaranteed for three years, which is 5% lower than our current rates.&nbsp;Approval of HSR for the voluntary student accident coverage and the catastrophic coverage will ensure an efficient and effective claim process should a large claim occur.</p>

<div class="itembody"><div><u>BACKGROUND</u>:</div>

<div>Pinellas County Schools utilizes the claims&#39; administration services of Johns Eastern Company to properly track and adjudicate workers&#39; compensation, liability&nbsp;and auto claims under its self-insurance program.&nbsp;Johns Eastern Company has effectively served as the district&#39;s third-party administrator since 2002, and their current agreement expires June 30, 2021.&nbsp; The services Johns Eastern Company provides to Pinellas County Schools&nbsp;include:</div>

<ul>
	<li>claims management&nbsp;and information services for employee workers&#39; compensation and liability incidents, bill processing and state reporting;</li>
	<li>a team of dedicated workers compensation and liability adjusters, including&nbsp;an onsite representative in Risk Management;</li>
	<li>medical management services, including two dedicated registered nurses and network discounts;</li>
	<li>excess&nbsp;insurance reporting management;</li>
	<li>attendance at hearings, mediations&nbsp;and client service claim review meetings;</li>
	<li>subrogation recoveries, specialty disability trust fund recoveries; and</li>
	<li>standard and custom loss reporting</li>
</ul>

<p>Johns Eastern Company&nbsp;has done an excellent job in managing and reducing workers&#39; compensation claim&nbsp;costs and have received exemplary audit results from the Office of the Auditor General and the Florida Division of Workers&#39; Compensation.&nbsp;Their liability team works closely with the School Board Attorney&#39;s Office and Risk Management and Insurance Department to manage liability claims and litigation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Based upon the current success of our workers&#39; compensation and liability program, the district requested&nbsp;USI Services, the district&#39;s broker consulting firm for property and casualty insurance, to directly negotiate&nbsp;competitive pricing based upon our dedicated adjuster/nurse case manager model for claims administration.&nbsp; After negotiations, Johns Eastern provided lower&nbsp;pricing and is recommended to continue as the district&#39;s third-party administrator of workers&#39; compensation and liability claims.</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u>RATIONALE</u>:</div>

<div>Johns Eastern Company has the expertise and resources to provide the services required to adjust claims, subrogate claims, issue payments,&nbsp;settle liability and workers&#39; compensation claims in conjunction with the district&nbsp;and ensure&nbsp;compliance with applicable federal and state laws. Johns Eastern Company is one of the leading third-party administrators for public entities and schools districts in the state of Florida, with 38 Florida school district clients.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The fees for July 1, 2021 - June 30, 2023&nbsp;are estimated at $975,000 per year; with&nbsp;a 3% increase each year beginning July 1, 2023.&nbsp; This fee includes&nbsp;medical management, handling up to 1,200 claims.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fees for the first three years of the agreement (July 1, 2021 &ndash; June 30, 2024) are lower than our current fees, for a total savings of $146,300.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div class="itembody"><div><u>BACKGROUND</u>:</div>

<div>The City of Dunedin (City) owns the property adjacent to&nbsp;Garrison-Jones Elementary School (School) where the Toronto Blue Jays Baseball Club operates their Player Development Complex (Complex). The Complex address is 3031 Garrison Road, Dunedin, FL, and shares&nbsp;a common property line with the&nbsp;School.&nbsp; The&nbsp;common property line is obstructed&nbsp;by mature pine and palm trees that are preventing&nbsp;the placement of a security fence on the common property line. In an effort to secure and separate the properties, the City would like to install a&nbsp;ten (10) foot tall chain link security fence with blue privacy fabric&nbsp;on&nbsp;the School property approximately five (5) feet west of the&nbsp;common property line.&nbsp;The City has agreed to pay for the fence and the continued maintenance for the entire term of the agreement.&nbsp;The agreement is for a period of twenty-five (25) years.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u>RATIONALE</u>:</div>

<div>As a result of this agreement,&nbsp;this&nbsp;fence will provide additional safety and security to the students and staff at Garrison-Jones Elementary School&nbsp;at no cost to the Board.</div>

<a class="goal" unique="BULGTS454027"><div class="name">4 - Strategic Direction 2. Learning in a Safe Environment</div></a>
</div>
<div class="itembody"><div><u>BACKGROUND</u>:</div>

<div>
<p>The Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act (Safety Act) requires an armed person to be present on each school campus while school is in session. Pinellas County Schools has followed this mandate from its inception and has hired School Security Officers/Guardians&nbsp;(SSOs) at 86 schools to supplement School Resource Officers to meet this requirement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Safety Act mandates that the training of SSOs&nbsp;be conducted by the Sheriff&#39;s Office. Initially, the training costs were included through&nbsp;funding provided by the state of Florida;&nbsp;however, that funding has been discontinued. It has become necessary for the district to cover the costs of training of the SSOs which includes&nbsp;firearms, self-defense, law, concealed weapon permits and qualifications as well as criminal background checks, polygraph examinations, drug screening and psychological assessments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The total cost of the training is expected to be $5,450 per candidate, averaging two classes of 20 candidates per school term in preparation for retirements and or attrition.&nbsp;The annual cost to train new SSOs is expected to be $218,000.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u>RATIONALE</u>:</div>

<div>
<p>The training of SSOs&nbsp;is necessary to remain in compliance with state law. Given the absence of state funding, the cost of the training is the responsibility of the&nbsp;district. If funding were to be made available in the future, it would potentially reduce or eliminate this cost. Approving this agreement would be in the best interest of the district to ensure safety and security&nbsp;requirements are being met as defined in statute.</p>

<div class="itembody"><div><u>BACKGROUND</u>:</div>

<div>Sandy Hook Promise Foundation is a national, non-profit organization that engages and empowers parents, schools and community organizations to prevent violence.&nbsp; Say Something and Start With Hello are violence prevention programs directed at students in all middle and high schools.&nbsp; Say Something teaches students how to look for warning signs, signals and threats and to say something to a trusted adult.&nbsp; Start With Hello teaches students how to be more inclusive and connected to one another by minimizing social isolation.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>In January&nbsp;2019, Pinellas County Schools launched the use of the Say Something Anonymous Reporting System (SS-ARS)&nbsp;app.&nbsp;The&nbsp;SS-ARS mobile app&nbsp;allows students and adults to submit secure and anonymous safety concerns to help identify and intervene with individuals at risk of violence against themselves or others.&nbsp; SS-ARS&nbsp;trains all middle schools and high schools&nbsp;on&nbsp;the curriculum from the Say Something Promise program.&nbsp; In addition, Sandy Hook&nbsp;Promise Foundation provides training and support for&nbsp;Students Against Violence Everywhere Promise Club&nbsp;in all secondary&nbsp;schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u>RATIONALE</u>:</div>

<div>With SS-ARS, students and adults can easily and completely confidentially report safety concerns to help prevent violence and tragedies. It is available 24/7 through the website, app or by phone, and certified counselors at the crisis center review&nbsp;and send&nbsp;all submissions to law enforcement and/or school administration for intervention. This has been highly successful with over 5,000 tips since its inception and very few false reports. We are confident that lives have been saved through this system of training, reporting and responding. Pinellas County Schools&#39; use of SS-ARS has been replicated across the country as a best practice model.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="itembody"><div><u>BACKGROUND</u>:</div>

<div>Pinellas Academy of Math and Science (PAMS) was approved in Pinellas County in 2011. The school opened in 2012 after a one-year planning year. PAMS is a K-8&nbsp;charter school currently serving approximately 910 students.&nbsp;The school is&nbsp;a Cognia educational institution and offers both the Cambridge International Pathway and the Galileo Middle School programs which provide&nbsp;accelerated coursework for students interested in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM).&nbsp;PAMS is managed by Charter School Associates, Inc., an Education Management Organization (EMO) that operates in multiple Florida counties. The school is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools / Council on Accreditation and School Improvement (SACS/CASI).

<div><u>RATIONALE</u>:</div>

<div>Pinellas Academy of Math and Science has consistently earned a school grade of &#39;B&#39; since 2015 and is on track, based on&nbsp;current data, to maintain at this performance level. The school maintains a positive fund balance and is in good financial condition. The school&nbsp;requested an additional 40 student stations as part of the contract negotiations, and the school facility supports the increase in enrollment. The increase results in a maximum enrollment of 950 students. A plan was submitted as part of the application for renewal that included&nbsp;a budget,&nbsp;an additional ESE Resource/Behavior staff member and room assignments for the additional 40 students.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="itembody"><div><u>BACKGROUND</u>:</div>

<div>Plato Academy Pinellas Park is a K-8 charter school, serving approximately 546 students&nbsp;and was&nbsp;officially approved to open in 2014, but opened in August 2015 after taking a planning year.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;one of nine&nbsp;Plato Academy schools in the Tampa Bay area. Seven of these schools are in Pinellas County, and four&nbsp;of the seven&nbsp;are high-performing charter schools.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Plato Academy Pinellas Park has not yet received high-performing status as the school received a grade of &#39;D&#39; in the 2017-2018 school year. The school received a two-year renewal in 2019 due to academic performance metrics.&nbsp;The school increased their school grade to a &#39;B&#39; in the 2018-2019 school year; however, consistent improvement in performance was needed to necessitate a longer contract term. The current contract expires June 30, 2021.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u>RATIONALE</u>:</div>

<div>Plato Academy Pinellas Park met seven&nbsp;of eight&nbsp;goals for the 2019-2020 school year. Due to the absence of state assessments, 12&nbsp;goals could not be assessed.&nbsp; Based on improvement in proficiency from baseline&nbsp;percentages in reading and mathematics and a review of current student data, the expectation for school performance in 2020-2021 should result in a school grade of &#39;B&#39; or higher. The school is also in a positive fund balance position and has been since 2016.</div>

<div class="itembody"><div><u>BACKGROUND</u>:</div>

<div><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Pinellas Preparatory Academy opened in 2002 and has been a high-performing charter school since the Academically High-Performing School District Legislation was enacted in 2011. The academy serves students in grades 4&ndash;8 in a creative environment focused on cooperative learning.&nbsp; It is currently under a 15-year renewal with a contract termination date of June 30, 2026.&nbsp; Pinellas Preparatory has consistently maintained a school grade of A or B since opening.</span></span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Pinellas Primary Academy opened in 2011 and has been a high-performing charter school since 2017. Pinellas Primary serves students in grades K-3 in a creative environment focused on cooperative learning.&nbsp; It is currently under a 15-year renewal with a contract termination date of June 30, 2031.&nbsp; Pinellas Primary has consistently maintained a school grade of A or B since opening. Both schools combined serve approximately 910 students.</span></span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u>RATIONALE</u>:</div>

<div>Pinellas Preparatory Academy and Pinellas Primary Academy occupy the same facility and share&nbsp;the same Governing Board. The schools are operated under the direction of the same principal&nbsp;and share some teachers,&nbsp;staff and resources. A consolidation would dissolve Pinellas Primary Academy, and Pinellas Preparatory Academy would convert to&nbsp;a K-8 charter school. The term of the consolidated charter agreement is for approximately ten (10) years and would terminate on June 30, 2031.</div>

<div class="itembody"><div>
<p><u>BACKGROUND</u>:</p>

<p>On November 20, 2020, the School Board adopted its Board Rule Regarding Face Coverings (&ldquo;Rule&rdquo;) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The consideration of the Rule has always been guided by t<span style="background:white">he assistance of infectious disease and pediatric specialists from Johns Hopkins All Children&rsquo;s Hospital, BayCare, Community Health Centers of Pinellas, Inc. and the Florida Department of Health-Pinellas when the pandemic first began in spring 2020.&nbsp;</span>Doctors toured schools,&nbsp;provided operational guidance for the district&rsquo;s ReOpening Plan&nbsp;and&nbsp;provided&nbsp;Pinellas County Schools teachers, nurses and other employees access to COVID-19 testing and the vaccine.&nbsp;The&nbsp;group&nbsp;has&nbsp;continued to be actively engaged throughout the school year&nbsp;and will remain&nbsp;a&nbsp;key&nbsp;partner in future planning.&nbsp;The Rule and other safety protocols within the Pinellas County Schools ReOpening Plan have served the district and its families,&nbsp;allowing&nbsp;schools to remain open and students and staff to attend in-person to the greatest extent possible during the 2020-21 school year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div>
<p>The proposed repeal of this Rule on June 9, 2021,&nbsp;at 5:00 p.m. is based upon the:</p>

<ul>
	<li>availability&nbsp;and opportunity for all employees&nbsp;to be fully vaccinated;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>commitment made&nbsp;to&nbsp;families and staff returning to in-person learning for the 2020-21 school year, as communicated in&nbsp;the Pinellas County Schools ReOpening plan; and</li>
	<li>current trends in Pinellas County demonstrating a&nbsp;reduction of new cases and positivity rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p><u>RATIONALE</u>:</p>

<p>The Florida Department of Education issued guidance that&nbsp;Executive Order&nbsp;21-102 issued by Governor DeSantis on May 3, 2021, regarding COVID-19&nbsp;only impacts city and county governments, and does not&nbsp;impact school districts and individual schools. The repeal of this Rule on June 9, 2021, at 5:00 p.m. will allow for successful completion of the 2020-21 school year and ensure that all employees have the opportunity to be fully vaccinated and maintain the district&#39;s&nbsp;commitment made&nbsp;to&nbsp;families and staff returning to in-person learning for the 2020-21 school year, as communicated in&nbsp;the Pinellas County Schools ReOpening&nbsp;Plan.&nbsp; Attached is the Rule that is&nbsp;proposed for repeal on June 9, 2021, at 5:00 p.m.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Board welcomes public comment. For those who wish to speak to the Board, please note the following:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">You are given three separate opportunities to speak. The first is during &quot;Public Comment&quot; on a topic not included in the agenda but pertaining to the general business of the district, and this opportunity occurs after adjournment of regular meetings. The second is on one or more agenda items upon which the Board will vote, and this opportunity occurs after the special order agenda at regular meetings and as appropriate at special meetings. The third is at public hearings, such as budget hearings, and second readings on Board policy, when you are able to speak to the Board before it takes action.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In each case, (1) you must register to speak with the Superintendent&rsquo;s designee at the entrance to the meeting room as described below; (2) you will be called in the order you registered with the Superintendent&#39;s designee; (3) you will be allotted three (3) minutes, which may only be extended with the approval of the chairperson; and (4) you may not yield your time to any other person. To avoid repetition, speakers supporting or opposing the same issue are encouraged to designate a spokesperson and have the spokesperson request that members of the audience supporting the position stand during the presentation.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If you wish to speak to agenda items, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker on agenda items concludes his or her comments whichever is later. If you wish to speak during the Public Comment period, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker concludes his or her comments, whichever is later. If you wish to speak during a Public Hearing, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker during the Public Hearing concludes his or her comments, whichever is later.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The following additional procedures apply depending upon the specific speaking opportunity:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Public Comment. The Board will hear public comment on the general business of the district after adjournment of regular meetings. The Board will not act on any matter you may raise during your presentation.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Numbered Agenda Items. Time will be set aside immediately following the special order agenda at regular meetings and as appropriate at special meetings for you to address numbered agenda items upon which the Board will vote. You may address as many agenda items as you wish during your three (3) minute period, other than items pertaining to employee or student discipline, or any other matter listed in Section 286.0114(3), F.S., such as ministerial acts or emergencies.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Public Hearings. Time will be set aside at each public hearing for you to speak on the agenda item. You must confine your comments to the agenda item.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Interrupt or terminate a speaker when his/her statement is not relevant, exceeds the time allotted, or is abusive, threatening, defamatory, obscene, profane, loud, interruptive, or otherwise of a disruptive or disorderly nature; and</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Order the removal of any person interfering with the expeditious or orderly process of the meeting, provided the Chairperson has first issued a warning that continued interference with the orderly processes of the meeting will result in removal.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Nothing herein is intended, nor shall anything be construed, to limit or restrain negative, positive, or neutral comments about the manner in which Board employees, agents, the Superintendent, and Board members carry out their duties in public employment or office.</span></span></p>
