<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span arial="" style="font-family:">Governor Ron DeSantis recognizes the state of Florida&rsquo;s observance of Career and Technical Education month for February 2021. </span></span><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span arial="" style="font-family:"><w:sdtpr></w:sdtpr></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span arial="" style="font-family:">Career and Technical Education (CTE) enjoys a long history in Pinellas County Schools. There are approximately 20,000 high school students enrolled in at least one course under the umbrella of career technical education. Additionally, the technical colleges boast an enrollment of 3,044 students in certificate and apprenticeship programs. Of this total, 220 are dual enrolled high school students.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span arial="" style="font-family:">The district offers 116 programs of study in our secondary and postsecondary schools, which provide students career pathway opportunities leading to high-skill, high-wage, high-demand careers. There are 41 registered high school Career and Professional Education (CAPE) academies and 15 registered middle school CAPE academies in the district.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span arial="" style="font-family:">In 2019-2020, elementary, middle and high school students earned 9,371 industry certifications. Many of these certifications articulate to postsecondary education earning college credit for students who achieve them. Seventy-four percent of postsecondary students earned industry certifications.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span arial="" style="font-family:">Student performance data show that students engaged in high-rigor interested-based programs such as career technical courses and career academies have higher attendance rates, higher grade point averages and higher graduation rates than their peers. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span arial="" style="font-family:">In Pinellas County, CTE programs feature high school and postsecondary partnerships that provide clear pathways for students and allow them to earn industry certifications that articulate to degree programs throughout the state. Most importantly, CTE programs prepare students to be career- and college-ready by providing core academic skills, employability skills and technical, job-specific skills.</span></span></p>

<div>
<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="line-height:normal">On November 2, 2004, January 29, 2008, November 6, 2012, November 8, 2016, and again on November 3, 2020, the citizens of Pinellas County voted to increase the ad valorem millage one-half mill for necessary operating expenses including funds to recruit and retain quality teachers, supplement reading programs, enhance music and art programs, and provide up-to-date materials and technology in Pinellas County schools. The School Board established specific target areas for the expenditure of these funds and a process for allocating the referendum dollars, outlining clear parameters for both monitoring and reporting expenditures to the public.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="line-height:normal">The Independent Citizens Referendum Oversight Committee (ICROC) functions as an advisory body to the School Board. The committee&rsquo;s purpose is to monitor the expenditure of referendum dollars over the four-year implementation period. The committee reviews quarterly expenditure reports that detail the items purchased by the specific program areas of teacher compensation, reading, visual arts, performing arts&nbsp;and technology. In addition, the committee further examines the detailed narratives specifying the use of the items in each program area and emphasizes how schools benefit from the expenditure of these funds.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="line-height:normal">This time of year allows the ICROC Chairperson to present the 2019-2020 Annual Report summarizing the expenditures for this year. It is important to note that while these funds follow the intent of the referendum guidelines to recruit and retain quality teachers, enhance program initiatives, update equipment and instructional materials to positively impact student learning, these funds are not used as replacement dollars for existing department budgets. </span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="line-height:normal">Pinellas County is proud of the community support achieved over this fifteen-year period and that our staff and students have benefited greatly from the thoughtful expenditures of the funds.</span></p>

<div class="itembody"><p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Meeting Procedures:</strong></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Board welcomes public comment. For those who wish to speak to the Board, please note the following:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">You are given three separate opportunities to speak. The first is during &quot;Public Comment&quot; on a topic not included in the agenda but pertaining to the general business of the district, and this opportunity occurs after adjournment of regular meetings. The second is on one or more agenda items upon which the Board will vote, and this opportunity occurs after the special order agenda at regular meetings and as appropriate at special meetings. The third is at public hearings, such as budget hearings, and second readings on Board policy, when you are able to speak to the Board before it takes action.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In each case, (1) you must register to speak with the Superintendent&rsquo;s designee at the entrance to the meeting room as described below; (2) you will be called in the order you registered with the Superintendent&#39;s designee; (3) you will be allotted three (3) minutes, which may only be extended with the approval of the chairperson; and (4) you may not yield your time to any other person. To avoid repetition, speakers supporting or opposing the same issue are encouraged to designate a spokesperson and have the spokesperson request that members of the audience supporting the position stand during the presentation.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If you wish to speak to agenda items, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker on agenda items concludes his or her comments whichever is later. If you wish to speak during the Public Comment period, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker concludes his or her comments, whichever is later. If you wish to speak during a Public Hearing, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker during the Public Hearing concludes his or her comments, whichever is later.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The following additional procedures apply depending upon the specific speaking opportunity:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Public Comment. The Board will hear public comment on the general business of the district after adjournment of regular meetings. The Board will not act on any matter you may raise during your presentation.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Numbered Agenda Items. Time will be set aside immediately following the special order agenda at regular meetings and as appropriate at special meetings for you to address numbered agenda items upon which the Board will vote. You may address as many agenda items as you wish during your three (3) minute period, other than items pertaining to employee or student discipline, or any other matter listed in Section 286.0114(3), F.S., such as ministerial acts or emergencies.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Public Hearings. Time will be set aside at each public hearing for you to speak on the agenda item. You must confine your comments to the agenda item.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Regulation of Disruptive Speech<br />
Board meetings are a limited open forum for First Amendment purposes, and your exercise of your First Amendment right of free speech in that context will be recognized and protected, subject to reasonable restrictions as to time, place, and manner. Applause is permitted only when awards are granted.<br />
To ensure the expeditious and orderly process of Board meetings, the Chairperson may:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Interrupt or terminate a speaker when his/her statement is not relevant, exceeds the time allotted, or is abusive, threatening, defamatory, obscene, profane, loud, interruptive, or otherwise of a disruptive or disorderly nature; and</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Order the removal of any person interfering with the expeditious or orderly process of the meeting, provided the Chairperson has first issued a warning that continued interference with the orderly processes of the meeting will result in removal.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Nothing herein is intended, nor shall anything be construed, to limit or restrain negative, positive, or neutral comments about the manner in which Board employees, agents, the Superintendent, and Board members carry out their duties in public employment or office.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Recording of Board Meetings<br />
Recordings are permitted under the following conditions:</span></span></p>

<div>Board Policy 6464 requires that schools solicit bids for yearbooks and commemorative items and that, if the cost for any purchase exceeds $50,000 from a single vendor, the school board must approve the selection. Largo High School requests&nbsp;approval to accept a three-year contract from John McLay&nbsp;&amp; Associates, Inc./Herff Jones with the option of an additional term of (3) years through the 2026-2027 school year. Bids were requested from Balfour, Jostens and John McLay &amp; Associates, Inc./Herff Jones. The committee considered contract specifications, quality, product selection, service history, warranty and pricing in arriving at the recommendation of&nbsp;John McLay&nbsp;&amp; Associates, Inc./Herff Jones. The total&nbsp;value of the contract&nbsp;will exceed the $50,000 threshold.&nbsp;The anticipated cost for the 2021-2022 school year commemorative items is $25,000.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u>RATIONALE</u>:&nbsp;</div>

<div>
<p>Chabad of St. Petersburg and the City of Dunedin, Florida have&nbsp;requested&nbsp;vehicle use agreements. Copies&nbsp;of the agreements are&nbsp;attached.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Under Florida Statute 1006.261, a school district may provide to any non-profit organization the option to contract for the use of school buses to transport school-age children if they can provide liability protection for the district. Risk Management has set the minimum amounts of liability protection at $1,000,000 per person/$2,000,000 per occurrence as allowed by School Board policy. It requires the organization to hold the district harmless from liability in exchange for services provided at cost. These agreements also stipulate that the use of buses by these groups will not conflict with regular school board transportation schedules.</p>
</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u>RATIONALE</u>:</div>

<div>
<p>The district will continue providing this type of transportation service to non-profit organizations, but shall not subject itself to additional liability exposures.</p>

</div>
<div class="itembody"><div><u>BACKGROUND</u>:</div>

<div>
<p>On November 2, 2004, January 29, 2008, November 6, 2012, November 8, 2016, and again on November 3, 2020, the citizens of Pinellas County voted to increase the ad valorem millage one-half mill for necessary operating expenses including funds to recruit and retain quality teachers, supplement reading programs, enhance music and art programs&nbsp;and provide up-to-date materials and technology in Pinellas County schools. The School Board established specific target areas for the expenditure of these funds and a process for allocating the referendum dollars, outlining clear parameters for both monitoring and reporting expenditures to the public.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Concurrent with the initial referendum, the School Board created the Independent Citizens Referendum Oversight Committee (ICROC) to function as an advisory body to the School Board. The committee&rsquo;s purpose is to monitor the expenditure of referendum dollars over the four-year implementation period. The committee reviews quarterly expenditure reports that detail the items purchased by the specific program areas of teacher compensation, reading, visual arts, performing arts&nbsp;and technology. In addition, the committee further examines the detailed narratives specifying the use of the items in each program area and emphasizes how schools benefit from the expenditure of these funds. The ICROC chair presents an&nbsp;annual report to the Board and the community each year. The Board established seven community organizations to serve on ICROC.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Policy 2140 - Independent Citizens Referendum Oversight Committee (ICROC), outlines the committee membership and oversight noted above.&nbsp; The proposed amendment updates&nbsp;the composition of the community organizations that serve on ICROC&nbsp;to include Arts for Complete Education (ACE).&nbsp;ACE has been an active advocacy organization supporting arts education within Pinellas County Schools for more than two decades and is committed to the spirit and implementation of the School Board policy for referendum oversight. With this amendment, ACE will replace&nbsp;Pinellas County SAC Association, Inc., which is no longer an active organization.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u>RATIONALE</u>:</div>

<div>
<p>The proposed change&nbsp;to Policy 2140 - Independent Citizens Referendum Oversight Committee (ICROC) ensures membership of&nbsp;current, active community organizations. The amendment recommends that&nbsp;Arts for Complete Education (ACE)&nbsp;replace&nbsp;the Pinellas County SAC Association, Inc for membership within ICROC.</p>

Students can access core curriculum and digital skill development resources at an increased rate than ever before. In targeted grades, students are increasing their usage of skill development programs both inside and outside of school and, as a result, becoming more proficient in the grade-level standards. </span></span></span></span></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="background:white"><span style="vertical-align:top"><span style="border:none windowtext 1.0pt; background:white; padding:0in"><span style="color:#333333">Exploration and enrichment opportunities have increased as more students are able to participate in virtual field trips, explore colleges and careers and digitally collaborate with their peers on student created projects. For example, on February 2, 2021, every 7th and 8th grade student in the district was able to participate in Junior Achievement Inspires, a virtual career fair featuring over 25 Tampa Bay companies. Students researched careers, spoke with live industry experts and learned what it takes to pursue a career in dozens of fields. Additionally, digital after-hours tutoring sessions, live parent and student events and enrichment activities have all increased as students and families have the technology at home to participate.</span></span></span></span></p>

The approved cost for this initiative was funded through a combination of district capital outlay and CARES Act funding.</span></span></span></span></p>

In the school year 2021-22, our second year of implementation, students in grades 3 and 10 will receive a laptop as part of the PCS Connects one-to-one initiative. Students in grades K-2 and 11-12 in need of a personal device will be provided one from the current PCS inventory.  </span></span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Board welcomes public comment. For those who wish to speak to the Board, please note the following:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">You are given three separate opportunities to speak. The first is during &quot;Public Comment&quot; on a topic not included in the agenda but pertaining to the general business of the district, and this opportunity occurs after adjournment of regular meetings. The second is on one or more agenda items upon which the Board will vote, and this opportunity occurs after the special order agenda at regular meetings and as appropriate at special meetings. The third is at public hearings, such as budget hearings, and second readings on Board policy, when you are able to speak to the Board before it takes action.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In each case, (1) you must register to speak with the Superintendent&rsquo;s designee at the entrance to the meeting room as described below; (2) you will be called in the order you registered with the Superintendent&#39;s designee; (3) you will be allotted three (3) minutes, which may only be extended with the approval of the chairperson; and (4) you may not yield your time to any other person. To avoid repetition, speakers supporting or opposing the same issue are encouraged to designate a spokesperson and have the spokesperson request that members of the audience supporting the position stand during the presentation.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If you wish to speak to agenda items, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker on agenda items concludes his or her comments whichever is later. If you wish to speak during the Public Comment period, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker concludes his or her comments, whichever is later. If you wish to speak during a Public Hearing, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker during the Public Hearing concludes his or her comments, whichever is later.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The following additional procedures apply depending upon the specific speaking opportunity:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Public Comment.

The Board will not act on any matter you may raise during your presentation.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Numbered Agenda Items. Time will be set aside immediately following the special order agenda at regular meetings and as appropriate at special meetings for you to address numbered agenda items upon which the Board will vote. You may address as many agenda items as you wish during your three (3) minute period, other than items pertaining to employee or student discipline, or any other matter listed in Section 286.0114(3), F.S., such as ministerial acts or emergencies.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Public Hearings. Time will be set aside at each public hearing for you to speak on the agenda item. You must confine your comments to the agenda item.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Interrupt or terminate a speaker when his/her statement is not relevant, exceeds the time allotted, or is abusive, threatening, defamatory, obscene, profane, loud, interruptive, or otherwise of a disruptive or disorderly nature; and</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Order the removal of any person interfering with the expeditious or orderly process of the meeting, provided the Chairperson has first issued a warning that continued interference with the orderly processes of the meeting will result in removal.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Nothing herein is intended, nor shall anything be construed, to limit or restrain negative, positive, or neutral comments about the manner in which Board employees, agents, the Superintendent, and Board members carry out their duties in public employment or office.</span></span></p>
