This is a time to highlight the struggles, successes and contributions of the African American and Black community in the United States. The theme for African American History Month 2021 is, &ldquo;The Black Family: Representation, Identity and Diversity.&quot; Additional African American History curriculum resources and professional development opportunities tied to this year&rsquo;s theme are provided by the Social Studies and Equity teams to all schools through the support of many community partnerships.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in"><span style="line-height:normal"><u>BACKGROUND</u>:</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in"><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="color:#323232">Student Services Professionals support high student achievement by identifying barriers to students&#39; academic success and social-emotional health by providing services that best meet their needs. Student Services employees include school psychologists, educational diagnosticians, social workers, counselors, health services employees (such as nurses and nurse assistants), prevention staff and members of the Crisis Response Team. The Student Services Employee of the Year is nominated by principals or colleagues for outstanding service to students and schools. This year&#39;s recipient for the Student Services Employee of the Year award is Erica McKnight, school psychologist. </span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in"><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="color:#323232">Ms. McKnight has worked in Pinellas County Schools for more than nine years. Her peers describe her as &ldquo;incredibly knowledgeable, resourceful and overall a well-versed professional. Over the years she has helped to grow our department into a more positive place to work.&rdquo; Just a few examples of all that Ms. McKnight does to go above and beyond include developing and running Commitment to Character awards at her school; organizing and overseeing a Pre-K student drop-off room; leading the department&#39;s Sunshine group; organizing a school psychologist team that maintains a portion of the Pinellas Trail; mentoring new school psychologists and directing a restorative leadership pilot. As a certified Youth Mental Health First Aid trainer, she conducts trainings throughout the district and community on mental health, trauma informed care, suicide prevention and other related topics. Her willingness to go above and beyond along with her dedication to students and families is only part of what has earned Ms. McKnight the title of 2020-2021 Student Services Employee of the Year. </span></span></p>

	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Numbered Agenda Items. Time will be set aside immediately following the special order agenda at regular meetings and as appropriate at special meetings for you to address numbered agenda items upon which the Board will vote. You may address as many agenda items as you wish during your three (3) minute period, other than items pertaining to employee or student discipline, or any other matter listed in Section 286.0114(3), F.S., such as ministerial acts or emergencies.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Public Hearings. Time will be set aside at each public hearing for you to speak on the agenda item. You must confine your comments to the agenda item.</span></span></li>

</div>
<div class="itembody"><div><u>BACKGROUND</u>:</div>

<div>
<p>Naviance is a college- and career-readiness platform for middle and high school students that utilizes postsecondary planning to assist students and families to reach their college and career goals.&nbsp; A major component of the Naviance implementation plan is to integrate the Naviance scope and sequence curriculum into the year-long school counseling comprehensive plan for middle and high schools. This consists of counselor seminars and in-class lessons&nbsp;which include opportunities for students to explore Naviance, establish their postsecondary and career goals, and learn about themselves, potential careers, college majors and scholarships.&nbsp; The 6-12th grade scope and sequence curriculum outlines grade specific Naviance tasks that provide opportunities for student self-discovery and career and college exploration. School counselors introduce the Naviance curriculum through English/Language Arts classes and extends access independently to staff, students and families to explore the curriculum at home.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div><u>RATIONALE</u>:</div>

<div>
<p>Pinellas County staff, students and families received access to the Naviance curriculum for a full year at no cost.&nbsp; During this trial period, staff determined that this component of the Naviance suite was essential for student success; therefore, they recommended an amendment to the current Naviance contract to include unlimited access to the Naviance curriculum for middle and high school students and staff for the remaining two years of the existing Naviance contract. The use of this curriculum has resulted in increased number of students completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid&nbsp;(FAFSA), applying to college, and other career pathways activities.</p>

</div>
<div class="itembody"><div><u>BACKGROUND</u>:</div>

<div>
<p>College Board officially launched the Pre-Advanced Placement Program (Pre-AP) nationally in 2018-19. Pre-AP courses provide grade-level appropriate instruction through focused course frameworks, engaging instructional resources and learning checkpoints. Pre-AP courses challenge students to build relevant critical thinking skills through close observation and analysis, evidence-based writing, higher-order thinking and academic conversation. The approaches to learning that are implemented in the courses are closely aligned to our strategic goals for delivering culturally relevant instruction in every classroom for every student and increasing the diversity of all advanced, honors&nbsp;and accelerated courses to mirror that of the school.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When a school commits to Pre-AP courses, they receive focused course frameworks that have the space for our curriculum leaders to ensure Florida standards are embedded in their entirety; engaging instructional resources that include model lessons with activities, engaging texts, and challenging practice; formative learning checkpoint assessments and an optional final exam; course-specific professional learning for teachers to review the course frameworks and best practices for implementation; leadership modules to support leaders in understanding the instruction design and program requirements; and a series of free webinars that are updated regularly to provide relevant information related to updates and/or additional model lessons/best practices.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pre-AP courses will further our mission to build the academic confidence of our students so they feel comfortable engaging in an Advanced Placement course to potentially earn college credit while still in high school. When schools adopt Pre-AP courses, they must attest that they will provide Pre-AP courses for ALL students so that all are challenged at the same rigorous level, helping us overcome the issue that the level of rigor some students receive in instruction is not as strong as what other students receive. By offering Pre-AP World History and Geography and Pre-AP Visual Arts in middle school we are diversifying the population of students who will opt into courses in these areas early in their high school years. Additionally, by offering a menu of six Pre-AP courses (English 1, English 2, Biology, Chemistry, Algebra 1, and Geometry) in five of our most diverse high schools we will diversify the population of students who enroll in AP courses in subsequent years.</p>
</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u>RATIONALE</u>:</div>

<div>
<p>Pre-AP supports the growth of Advanced Placement enrollment and strengthens students&rsquo; ability to earn a score. In accordance, the Pre-AP Program will be funded through the annual Advanced Placement budget allocation, which earns additional bonus FTE each year with the increased number of qualifying AP exam scores (3 or higher).</p>

<div class="itembody"><div><u>BACKGROUND</u>:</div>

<div>
<p>The district owns a .8-acre parcel at 1235 Holt Avenue in Clearwater, located across the street from the former Curtis Fundamental School site. The district has provided&nbsp;this land for&nbsp;prekindergarten services to approximately 100 at-risk neighborhood children since 1977 at no cost. The land was originally leased to the Community Pride Child Care Center of Clearwater, but was acquired by the Coordinated Community Services, LLC in 2012 and the R&rsquo;Club in 2014.&nbsp;The R&#39;Club has since been&nbsp;responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the facility and agreement. The agreement was renewed in 2017, and expired in 2019. The agreement is backdated to ensure continued coverage for both the district&nbsp;and the R&#39;Club.&nbsp;This agreement is for a five-year period&nbsp;beginning on July 1, 2019, and ending on June 30, 2024.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div><u>RATIONALE</u>:</div>

<div>This partnership will continue to help the community and the district with prekindergarten readiness, which is one of the school district&#39;s measures of highest student achievement.&nbsp;&nbsp;The renewal of this agreement will allow the R&rsquo;Club&nbsp;to continue their program while holding the school district harmless through appropriate agreement language.</div>

<div>
<p>ARTZ 4 Life Academy, City of Seminole, Lealman and Asian Neighborhood Family Center, Inc., R&#39;Club Child Care, Inc.&nbsp;and YMCA of Greater St. Petersburg have&nbsp;requested vehicle use agreements. Copies&nbsp;of the agreements are&nbsp;attached.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Under Florida Statute 1006.261, a school district may provide to any non-profit organization the option to contract for the use of school buses to transport school-age children if they can provide liability protection for the district. Risk Management has set the minimum amounts of liability protection at $1,000,000 per person/$2,000,000 per occurrence as allowed by School Board policy. It requires the organization to hold the district harmless from liability in exchange for services provided at cost. These agreements also stipulate that the use of buses by these groups will not conflict with regular school board transportation schedules.</p>
</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u>RATIONALE</u>:</div>

<div>
<p>The district will continue providing this type of transportation service to non-profit organizations, but shall not subject itself to additional liability exposures.</p>

<div>
<p><span style="background:white"><span style="color:#222222">Bureau of School Business Services - Fixed Capital Outlay office released a request for applications for school districts to receive nonrecurring capital outlay funds to improve the physical security of school buildings based on the security risk assessment and creation of the security plan conducted in consultation with local law enforcement. In year one the district was awarded approximately $3.2M and spent $1.7M on IP paging, $300K on window protection&nbsp;and $1.2M on access control. In year two the district was awarded $1.7M and spent $1.15M on IP paging and $550K on access control. This money has been instrumental in allowing the district to upgrade its technology-based security systems that are aligned with Tier 2 and Tier 3 strategies as recommended by the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission. All proceeds of this grant will be used to further enhance the security of school sites as identified during the security risk assessments and identified by the district security plan. School districts are required to provide charter schools their proportionate share of funds upon receipt of the charter school&#39;s security risk assessment.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in"><span style="line-height:normal">The attached Amendment provides that the Agreement will be renewed for an additional three-year period, such that the renewed Agreement would expire on July 31, 2024. It also provides that the Agreement would be extended an additional year upon successful evaluations without the need for additional School Board action, but that the School Board could always vote not to extend for this additional year. No other provisions of the Agreement would be changed by the Amendment.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Board welcomes public comment. For those who wish to speak to the Board, please note the following:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">You are given three separate opportunities to speak. The first is during &quot;Public Comment&quot; on a topic not included in the agenda but pertaining to the general business of the district, and this opportunity occurs after adjournment of regular meetings. The second is on one or more agenda items upon which the Board will vote, and this opportunity occurs after the special order agenda at regular meetings and as appropriate at special meetings. The third is at public hearings, such as budget hearings, and second readings on Board policy, when you are able to speak to the Board before it takes action.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In each case, (1) you must register to speak with the Superintendent&rsquo;s designee at the entrance to the meeting room as described below; (2) you will be called in the order you registered with the Superintendent&#39;s designee; (3) you will be allotted three (3) minutes, which may only be extended with the approval of the chairperson; and (4) you may not yield your time to any other person. To avoid repetition, speakers supporting or opposing the same issue are encouraged to designate a spokesperson and have the spokesperson request that members of the audience supporting the position stand during the presentation.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If you wish to speak to agenda items, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker on agenda items concludes his or her comments whichever is later. If you wish to speak during the Public Comment period, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker concludes his or her comments, whichever is later. If you wish to speak during a Public Hearing, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker during the Public Hearing concludes his or her comments, whichever is later.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The following additional procedures apply depending upon the specific speaking opportunity:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Public Comment. The Board will hear public comment on the general business of the district after adjournment of regular meetings. The Board will not act on any matter you may raise during your presentation.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Numbered Agenda Items. Time will be set aside immediately following the special order agenda at regular meetings and as appropriate at special meetings for you to address numbered agenda items upon which the Board will vote. You may address as many agenda items as you wish during your three (3) minute period, other than items pertaining to employee or student discipline, or any other matter listed in Section 286.0114(3), F.S., such as ministerial acts or emergencies.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Public Hearings. Time will be set aside at each public hearing for you to speak on the agenda item. You must confine your comments to the agenda item.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Regulation of Disruptive Speech<br />
Board meetings are a limited open forum for First Amendment purposes, and your exercise of your First Amendment right of free speech in that context will be recognized and protected, subject to reasonable restrictions as to time, place, and manner. Applause is permitted only when awards are granted.<br />
To ensure the expeditious and orderly process of Board meetings, the Chairperson may:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Interrupt or terminate a speaker when his/her statement is not relevant, exceeds the time allotted, or is abusive, threatening, defamatory, obscene, profane, loud, interruptive, or otherwise of a disruptive or disorderly nature; and</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Order the removal of any person interfering with the expeditious or orderly process of the meeting, provided the Chairperson has first issued a warning that continued interference with the orderly processes of the meeting will result in removal.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Nothing herein is intended, nor shall anything be construed, to limit or restrain negative, positive, or neutral comments about the manner in which Board employees, agents, the Superintendent, and Board members carry out their duties in public employment or office.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Recording of Board Meetings<br />
Recordings are permitted under the following conditions:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">No obstructions are created between the Board and the audience.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">No interviews are conducted in the meeting room while the Board is in session.</span></span></li>
