<div class="itembody"><div>
<p style="margin-bottom:0in"><span style="line-height:normal"><u>BACKGROUND</u>:</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in"><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="background:white"><span style="color:black">Thomas B. Dobies was born and raised in Tarpon Springs. He has been serving the community as a funeral director since 1975. He opened his first funeral home in Holiday, FL in 1979, and later expanded his services to four additional locations in Pasco, Hernando and Pinellas counties. Mr. Dobies is very involved in the community and has supported hundreds of local organizations through the years with his time and treasure. </span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in"><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="background:white"><span style="color:#333333">Thomas Dobies is also very well known for his generosity and support of local law enforcement. In the past 15 years, he has donated a substantial amount of money towards the purchase of police dogs to support police departments throughout the Tampa Bay area. The cost for purchasing high-quality police dogs is over $10,000 per dog and without Mr. Dobies generosity, police departments would limit their access to this valuable resource. Pinellas County Schools&rsquo; Police was one of those local police departments to benefit from Mr. Dobies donation and receive their police dog, Dobies, earlier this year. Officer Barbara Baugher and her dog Dobies are a nationally certified K-9 team and work throughout our school district to protect and serve Pinellas County Schools&#39; students and staff.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in"><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="background:white"><span style="color:#333333">The district would like to thank Thomas Dobies for his commitment to the safety and well-being of our students and recognize him for his overwhelming generosity.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in"><span style="line-height:normal"><u>BACKGROUND</u>:</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in"><span style="line-height:normal">First Home Bank is based out of St. Petersburg with a mission to engage and support the community they serve. Their commitment to volunteerism is part of the First Home Bank difference. To expand on this commitment to the community, First Home Bank implemented a Quarterly Community Partnership initiative that started in 2021. This plan was created to help increase volunteerism throughout the First Home Bank family, so their staff could continue to make a difference in their community.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in"><span style="line-height:normal">First Home Bank has identified four causes that they will be supporting each quarter through donations and volunteering. Each cause was chosen specifically with their strategic focus areas in mind, Community and Human Services, Education and Financial Literacy, Arts and Culture and Animal Services and Programs. First Home Bank selected the Helping Educate All in Transition (HEAT) Program as their final Quarterly Community Partnership for 2021. <span style="background:white"><span style="color:black">The HEAT program serves students from birth to twenty-one years of age who are eligible to receive services under the federal McKinney-Vento Act.</span></span> The HEAT Program will receive a $5,000 donation to support the students experiencing homelessness in Pinellas County. In addition to this generous donation, 23 volunteers from the First Home Bank team spent an entire day at Mount Vernon Elementary School working on a landscaping project to improve the curb appeal at this school. The district recognizes and thanks First Home Bank for their donation of time and treasure.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Board welcomes public comment. For those who wish to speak to the Board, please note the following:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">You are given three separate opportunities to speak. The first is during &quot;Public Comment&quot; on a topic not included in the agenda but pertaining to the general business of the district, and this opportunity occurs after adjournment of regular meetings. The second is on one or more agenda items upon which the Board will vote, and this opportunity occurs after the special order agenda at regular meetings and as appropriate at special meetings. The third is at public hearings, such as budget hearings, and second readings on Board policy, when you are able to speak to the Board before it takes action.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In each case, (1) you must register to speak with the Superintendent&rsquo;s designee at the entrance to the meeting room as described below; (2) you will be called in the order you registered with the Superintendent&#39;s designee; (3) you will be allotted three (3) minutes, which may only be extended with the approval of the chairperson; and (4) you may not yield your time to any other person. To avoid repetition, speakers supporting or opposing the same issue are encouraged to designate a spokesperson and have the spokesperson request that members of the audience supporting the position stand during the presentation.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If you wish to speak to agenda items, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker on agenda items concludes his or her comments whichever is later. If you wish to speak during the Public Comment period, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker concludes his or her comments, whichever is later. If you wish to speak during a Public Hearing, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker during the Public Hearing concludes his or her comments, whichever is later.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The following additional procedures apply depending upon the specific speaking opportunity:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Public Comment. The Board will hear public comment on the general business of the district after adjournment of regular meetings. The Board will not act on any matter you may raise during your presentation.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Numbered Agenda Items. Time will be set aside immediately following the special order agenda at regular meetings and as appropriate at special meetings for you to address numbered agenda items upon which the Board will vote. You may address as many agenda items as you wish during your three (3) minute period, other than items pertaining to employee or student discipline, or any other matter listed in Section 286.0114(3), F.S., such as ministerial acts or emergencies.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Public Hearings. Time will be set aside at each public hearing for you to speak on the agenda item. You must confine your comments to the agenda item.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Regulation of Disruptive Speech<br />
Board meetings are a limited open forum for First Amendment purposes, and your exercise of your First Amendment right of free speech in that context will be recognized and protected, subject to reasonable restrictions as to time, place, and manner. Applause is permitted only when awards are granted.<br />
To ensure the expeditious and orderly process of Board meetings, the Chairperson may:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Interrupt or terminate a speaker when his/her statement is not relevant, exceeds the time allotted, or is abusive, threatening, defamatory, obscene, profane, loud, interruptive, or otherwise of a disruptive or disorderly nature; and</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Order the removal of any person interfering with the expeditious or orderly process of the meeting, provided the Chairperson has first issued a warning that continued interference with the orderly processes of the meeting will result in removal.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Nothing herein is intended, nor shall anything be construed, to limit or restrain negative, positive, or neutral comments about the manner in which Board employees, agents, the Superintendent, and Board members carry out their duties in public employment or office.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Recording of Board Meetings<br />
Recordings are permitted under the following conditions:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>

<p><u>BACKGROUND</u>:</p>

<p>Each year, the district reviews policies in alignment with legislative updates as well as district and state practices.&nbsp;The proposed amendments to the policies below align with the legislative updates that were enacted into law on July 1, 2021.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Policy 2410 -&nbsp;Special Services</p>

<ul>
	<li>Added language to align with HB 590 requiring the Superintendent to annually report to the Department of Education the number of involuntary examinations initiated at schools, on school buses or at school-sponsored activities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Policy 1140 -&nbsp;Discipline of Administrators, Policy 3140 -&nbsp;Discipline of Instructional Staff and&nbsp;Policy 4140 -&nbsp;Discipline of Support Staff</p>

<ul>
	<li>Added language to align with HB 131 that requires all reports of alleged misconduct involving the safety of a student to be investigated regardless of whether the employee involved resigned or was terminated prior to the conclusion of the investigation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Policy 5630.01 - Use of Seclusion and Restraint on Students with Disabilities</p>

<ul>
	<li>Removed language to align with HB 149 that prohibits the use of seclusion or mechanical restraint on students with disabilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Policy 9800 &ndash; Charter Schools</p>

<ul>
	<li>Adjusted language to align with HB 1028 which removes the February 1st&nbsp;deadline to submit a charter school application and allows the charter school to determine the opening date of the school. Additional language was added in alignment with legislation that states if a charter school changes its curriculum focus, the change is automatically assumed accepted if the curriculum aligns with state standards.</li>
</ul>

<p><u>RATIONALE</u>:</p>

<p>The proposed amendments to these policies ensure alignment with legislative updates, as well as state and district procedures.</p>

In between full revisions, the SP&amp;P is revised as needed based upon changes in case law, federal guidance or state interpretation of IDEA. FDOE typically approves the district&rsquo;s SP&amp;P in the spring of each year. This year because of legal review, the SP&amp;P for the DOE approval of the 2020-21 school year was not released until July&nbsp;2021 after the school year was complete.&nbsp;The 2020-21 school year was a triennial complete review/revision year. Following FDOE approval, the new ESE SP&amp;P is brought to the school board for approval prior to signature by the superintendent. The new ESE SP&amp;P will be in effect through the end of the 2020-21 school year.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in"><span style="line-height:normal"><u>BACKGROUND</u>:</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in"><span style="line-height:normal">Each year the district reviews policies in alignment with district practices. The proposed amendments to the policies below relate to the Student Progression Plan.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in"><span style="line-height:normal">Policy 5420.03 &ndash; Reporting Student Progress and Class Ranking</span></p>

<ul>
	<li style="margin-bottom:0in"><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="tab-stops:list .5in">The proposed amendment adds clarifying language for parents and students as to the original intended purpose of the early exam process and further outlines acceptable reasons to request an early exam. This includes students who are moving out of the district prior to final exams or for students who are experiencing an unforeseen hardship such as a medical emergency or the death of a family member, etc.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in"><span style="line-height:normal">Policy 5430 &ndash; Class Rank</span></p>

<ul>
	<li style="margin-bottom:0in"><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="tab-stops:list .5in">The proposed amendment adds the HOPE course to the list of courses eligible to be deleted from the class ranking computation as it relates to the Valedictorian and Salutatorian designations. The HOPE course is an unweighted course, and in recent years, there are growing numbers of students who complete the HOPE course prior to their 9th grade year. Those students, if they are in contention for the Valedictorian/Salutatorian designations after the second semester of their senior year, have a mathematical grade point advantage over students who take the HOPE course after they enter high school. </span></span></li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in"><span style="line-height:normal"><u>RATIONALE</u>:</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in"><span style="line-height:normal">The proposed amendments to these policies ensure alignment with district practices.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in"><span style="line-height:normal">Policy 5420.03 &ndash; Reporting Student Progress and Class Ranking</span></p>

<ul>
	<li style="margin-bottom:0in"><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="tab-stops:list .5in">Our schools are experiencing a significant uptick in requests for early exams for leisure travel which is not a qualifying reason for an early exam. This recommended change in policy allows for parents and students to better understand the intent of this policy in order to avoid submitting&nbsp;a request&nbsp;that does not meet the original intent of this policy.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in"><span style="line-height:normal">Policy 5430 &ndash; Class Rank</span></p>

<ul>
	<li style="margin-bottom:0in"><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="tab-stops:list .5in">Up until now, including the HOPE course has not impacted the computations and selections for Valedictorian/Salutatorian in our high schools, but the upward trend of HOPE completions prior to high school inevitably will cause an issue in the years to come. This recommended change will ensure we continue to have a level playing field for all students, regarding the inclusion of unweighted classes that are required for graduation, when it comes to the computation that identifies the Valedictorian and Salutatorian designations each school year. </span></span></li>

<div class="itembody"><div><u>BACKGROUND</u>:</div>

<div>The warehouse receives requests from schools and district sites to pick up surplus and obsolete technology equipment. Computer equipment that is over 5 years old and unrepairable is sent to the surplus warehouse to be physically checked in by onsite district support staff. Any computers found to be useful by onsite technical support staff may get reassigned to schools or district sites. Schools may keep obsolete technology equipment that meets their educational needs. Computers that are deemed no longer useful to the district are sent to a recycling company.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u>RATIONALE</u>:</div>

<div>The school board authorizes the disposal of surplus property. Florida Statutes 274.05, 274.06 and 274.07 provides direction for the disposition and recording of surplus assets which are obsolete and no longer serve a useful function within the district.</div>

<div class="itembody"><div><u>BACKGROUND</u>:</div>

<div>Florida law allows the School Board to make changes in the boundaries of its member&nbsp;residence areas that it deems necessary and appropriate, provided such changes are made in odd-numbered years and do not affect the residence qualifications of any incumbent member during the term for which they were&nbsp;elected.&nbsp;See s. 1001.36, F.S.&nbsp;The federal decennial census conducted in 2020 prompted&nbsp;the&nbsp;Pinellas County Board of County Commissioners (BCC) to approve&nbsp;changes to its single-member&nbsp;residence areas&nbsp;on December 7, 2021.&nbsp;The School Board discussed its redistricting options at its public workshop meeting on December 8, 2021.&nbsp;Any redistricting by the School Board must be codified in a resolution.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u>RATIONALE</u>:</div>

<div>On December 7, 2021, the BCC&nbsp;approved new district boundaries using the 2020 census data.&nbsp;In&nbsp;order to provide consistency of districts between the School Board and the BCC, and in accordance with&nbsp;past practice, the attached resolution sets the same boundaries for its single-member district residence areas that the BCC approved on December 7, 2021.</div>

<p><u>BACKGROUND</u>:&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the 2020 federal decennial census, the Pinellas County Board of County Commissioners (BCC) voted on December 7, 2021, to amend its single-member district boundaries.&nbsp;The School Board discussed its redistricting options at its public workshop meeting on December 8, 2021.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>RATIONALE</u>:&nbsp;</p>

<p>To maintain consistency for voters, the School Board has approved a Resolution changing the School Board single-member district boundaries to mirror the BCC&rsquo;s single-member district boundaries approved on December 7, 2021.&nbsp;An amendment to Policy 0143.1 is necessary to conform to the Resolution approved earlier at this meeting.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Board welcomes public comment. For those who wish to speak to the Board, please note the following:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">You are given three separate opportunities to speak. The first is during &quot;Public Comment&quot; on a topic not included in the agenda but pertaining to the general business of the district, and this opportunity occurs after adjournment of regular meetings. The second is on one or more agenda items upon which the Board will vote, and this opportunity occurs after the special order agenda at regular meetings and as appropriate at special meetings. The third is at public hearings, such as budget hearings, and second readings on Board policy, when you are able to speak to the Board before it takes action.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In each case, (1) you must register to speak with the Superintendent&rsquo;s designee at the entrance to the meeting room as described below; (2) you will be called in the order you registered with the Superintendent&#39;s designee; (3) you will be allotted three (3) minutes, which may only be extended with the approval of the chairperson; and (4) you may not yield your time to any other person. To avoid repetition, speakers supporting or opposing the same issue are encouraged to designate a spokesperson and have the spokesperson request that members of the audience supporting the position stand during the presentation.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If you wish to speak to agenda items, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker on agenda items concludes his or her comments whichever is later. If you wish to speak during the Public Comment period, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker concludes his or her comments, whichever is later. If you wish to speak during a Public Hearing, you must register prior to the time the Chairperson calls for speakers or before the last speaker during the Public Hearing concludes his or her comments, whichever is later.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The following additional procedures apply depending upon the specific speaking opportunity:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Public Comment. The Board will hear public comment on the general business of the district after adjournment of regular meetings. The Board will not act on any matter you may raise during your presentation.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Numbered Agenda Items. Time will be set aside immediately following the special order agenda at regular meetings and as appropriate at special meetings for you to address numbered agenda items upon which the Board will vote. You may address as many agenda items as you wish during your three (3) minute period, other than items pertaining to employee or student discipline, or any other matter listed in Section 286.0114(3), F.S., such as ministerial acts or emergencies.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Public Hearings. Time will be set aside at each public hearing for you to speak on the agenda item. You must confine your comments to the agenda item.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Regulation of Disruptive Speech<br />
Board meetings are a limited open forum for First Amendment purposes, and your exercise of your First Amendment right of free speech in that context will be recognized and protected, subject to reasonable restrictions as to time, place, and manner. Applause is permitted only when awards are granted.<br />
To ensure the expeditious and orderly process of Board meetings, the Chairperson may:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Interrupt or terminate a speaker when his/her statement is not relevant, exceeds the time allotted, or is abusive, threatening, defamatory, obscene, profane, loud, interruptive, or otherwise of a disruptive or disorderly nature; and</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Order the removal of any person interfering with the expeditious or orderly process of the meeting, provided the Chairperson has first issued a warning that continued interference with the orderly processes of the meeting will result in removal.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Nothing herein is intended, nor shall anything be construed, to limit or restrain negative, positive, or neutral comments about the manner in which Board employees, agents, the Superintendent, and Board members carry out their duties in public employment or office.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Recording of Board Meetings<br />
Recordings are permitted under the following conditions:</span></span></p>
