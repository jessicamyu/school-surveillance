<div class="itembody"><br><br><font face="Arial">Gwinnett County Public Schools is seeking public comment regarding the use of Title 1, Part A - American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds.  The school district is receiving these funds to support its 42 Title 1 schools.  A portion of these ARRA funds can be used to support parent options such as Public School Choice or Supplemental Educational Services in the district's three Needs Improvement Schools.  The district has already set aside sufficient funds to cover these options in its Regular Title 1 Allocation and is seeking approval from the Georgia Department of Education to redirect the funds.  The funds will be allocated back to all 42 Title 1 schools to support school improvement efforts.  Public comment can be given to the School Board at 6:30 p.m. on November 12, 2009.</font><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></div>
